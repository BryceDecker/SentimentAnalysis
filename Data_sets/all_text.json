  "Q. Three seasons ago after you beat Toronto, you told Cleveland.com that you didn't have anything left to prove when you were asked what you have left to prove. I wanted to know if that's changed over the past three years.  Did you feel you had something to prove, and why is this one so important for you?\nLeBRON JAMES:   I think personally thinking I have something to prove fuels me.  It fueled me over this last year and a half since the injury.  It fueled me because no matter what I've done in my career to this point, there's still little rumblings of doubt or comparing me to the history of the game and has he done this, has he done that.\nSo having that in my head, having that in my mind, saying to myself, why not still have something to prove, I think it fuels me.\nQ. All the circumstances surrounding this one, being in Orlando, having a four-and-a-half-month hiatus away from family, everything going on in the country, how does that add context to this fourth ring versus the other three?\nLeBRON JAMES:   I think they are all special in their own right.  They all have their obstacles, things that went on throughout the course of the year, both on and off the floor.\nBut one is not less than the other, because when you're able to put yourself in this position to be able to win a championship, first thing you start to think about is how much work you've put in over the course of the year.  How much you've sacrificed, how much you've dedicated to the game and to your craft.  That's always been the most fulfilling thing for me, besides seeing my teammates as happy as they are.  Being able to know that you can put the work in, literally trust the process, live about the process and then see the results.  I think not only from a basketball player, but from everybody, whatever craft, whatever workspace you're in, to be able to put the work in and live along the process and build along the process and be able to see results, I think we all live for that moment.\nQ. Could you sense with the mental wear of the bubble that it was getting to other teams?  And in the last few days, was there kind of a weird feeling of you're reaching not just possibly winning a championship but reaching the end of this journey?  Did that feel different than the other title runs?\nLeBRON JAMES:   To answer your first question, with so much going on inside the bubble and everything and us going into the unknown, it was kind of hard for me personally -- once I got inside here, I said, okay, this is my mission: I want to win a championship; this is why I'm here.  It was hard for me to focus on other teams and what other players were feeling.  I didn't engage in that.  I didn't look for it.  I wanted to keep my energy in the right space.\nAnd over the last couple days, you definitely thought about it.  You thought about just being here, how successful it is.  I commend Adam Silver and the NBA, Michele Roberts, Chris Paul and everybody at the NBPA to make this happen and to make this work.  I think we can all say from the social injustice conversations, the voter suppression, police brutality, to have this platform, have our players be able to unite like that, it's something that you will miss.  You will think back on it.\nI think one of the biggest things, besides the social injustice, all the things I mentioned, we had zero positive tests.  We had zero positives tests for as long as we were here, 90-some days, 95 days maybe for myself.  I had a little calendar I was checking off.  But on a serious note, no positive tests.  That's a success for everybody that was involved.\nQ. What about this partnership that you have with Anthony makes it particularly special to you?\nLeBRON JAMES:   I can't really explain it.  There's just certain things you just know.  And any type of relationship, you kind of just feel, you know that vibe.  You have that respect.  You have that drive.  Sometimes you can't explain what links you with somebody, and then it's that organic.\nSometimes, you don't even try to explain it.  You guys ask me about my relationship with AD, the first thing I think about is the respect, the no ego, the challenging each other.  We want each other to be better than actually ourselves.  I want AD to be better than me.  AD want me to be better than him.  Every single night, every single day.  And we challenge ourselves.  I think that's a part of it.\nQ. With about three minutes left, you looked over and you saw Anthony sitting there, probably the realization of what you guys accomplished hitting him for the first time.  I'm wondering, how much of that reminded you of 2012 for you?  And what did that first title do for your career and what can this do for AD moving forward?\nLeBRON JAMES:   It definitely reminded me of it, just the excitement, the \"I can't believe this.\"   I definitely saw myself, 27 LeBron, 27 AD.  I definitely saw myself in that.\nAnd what it did for me in my career, it basically let me know that the work I put in on my craft, and the way I play the game, how I was taught to play the game when I picked up a basketball when I was eight years old, it's okay to play that way and be able to win.  No matter how many people tell you, you should maybe shoot more, you should maybe do this more, you should maybe be like him more, it let me know that the way I play basketball and the way I was taught to play basketball is the right way to play it, because you do see results.\nAnd then it just continues to boost your confidence.  Not saying that AD doesn't already have confidence, but it takes it to another level.\nQ. You talk about how you can't focus on other teams and their bubble experience, but for you outside looking in, it seemed like you were locked in from the beginning of the entire journey to now. I imagine you had your days off the court when it comes to the personal sacrifice, when it comes to keeping this group together.  Is that the case?  Were there ups and downs?  How different is just is this championship feeling?\nLeBRON JAMES:   To answer your first question, absolutely.  I think you wouldn't be human if you didn't have ups and downs in the bubble.  At times I was questioning myself, should I be here?  Is this worth sacrificing my family?  So many things.  I've never been without my family this long.  Missing the days of my daughter being in kindergarten, even though it's through Zoom.  Missing my son's 16th birthday, which we all know is a big birthday if you have kids. Seeing my middle child continue to grow and be who he is.  First of all, big-time shoutout to the late great Steve Jobs, because without him, without his vision, those FaceTime calls wouldn't be possible.\nAbsolutely, I've had ups and downs throughout this journey.  For some odd reason, I was able to keep the main thing the main thing.  When I talked about all the stuff that I missed, they understood that, too, and that made it a lot easier for me.\nTo answer your second question, it doesn't matter where it is if you win a championship.  A bubble, Miami, Golden State -- it doesn't matter.  When you get to this point, it's one of the greatest feelings in the world for a basketball player to be able to win at the highest level.\nQ. Does any one of your championships stand out in terms of the difficulty?\nLeBRON JAMES:   Well, I can't sit here and say one is more challenging than the other or one is more difficult than the other.  I can just say that I've never won with this atmosphere.  None of us have.  We've never been a part of this.  If you've been here throughout the start -- I mean, we got here July 9th.  Our ballclub got here July 9th.  It's October what -- I don't even , October 11th now.\nSo this was very challenging and difficult.  It played with your mind.  It played with your body.  You're away from some of the things that you're so accustomed to to make you be the professional that you are.  So this is right up there.\nI heard some rumblings from people that are not in the bubble, oh, you don't have to travel, whatever. People just doubting what goes on in here.  This is right up there with one of the greatest accomplishments I've had.\nQ. When you signed with the Lakers, over the course of the first year, Magic stepping down and everything that went into your start here, was there ever a moment where your mind wandered or you thought maybe the hill would be too high or hard to climb to get back to this point in L.A., or if not, how did you know or what gave you faith that you guys would get here?\nLeBRON JAMES:   What gave me faith is that Rob Pelinka told me he would do whatever it takes to make sure that we would become a winning franchise once again.  Obviously, championships are not promised, and I don't expect that.  But he said he would do whatever it takes to make this franchise, whatever personnel changes he needs to make, any part of our organization, he would do it, because he wanted to win just as much.\nAnd for me, being able to get Jeanie back to this point, that's something that fueled me as well.  This is a historic franchise and to be a part of this is something that I'll be able to talk about and my grandkids and kids will be able to talk about; their pawpaw played for the Los Angeles Lakers.  It's like playing for the Yankees and winning or playing for the Cowboys and winning a Super Bowl, or the Patriots.  It's like playing for the Red Sox.\nSo to be able to win with a historical franchise is something that, no matter if your mind wavers away, you can always remember what you're doing it for.\nQ. You and Jeanie shared a long hug right after as the trophy presentation was being prepared.  Did you say anything to her?\nLeBRON JAMES:   I don't want to lie to you.  I did, but if Jeanie at some point would ever want to reveal what I said to her, that's up to her.  It was just a special moment and I know how special it was for her.  So it was just in the words of, \"I'm proud to be a Laker.\"\n",
  "Q. What's your Finals experience over the years taught you about how to respond to a game like this and how to put that out to the rest of your teammates?\nLeBRON JAMES:   I mean for me, I've always stayed even keeled.  You know, throughout the highs, throughout the lows, you stay even keeled and get better with the process.  You stay in the moment, which I am, and understanding that we can be better. And how we make the adjustments and how we learn from tonight, tomorrow in our film session and when we get together and prepare ourselves for Sunday, will show the difference.\nQ. I was wondering if you could take us through that last minute of the game, the ups and downs, and your mentality when you were driving in. Frank described it as you were ready to take on the whole team and then you saw Danny open at the top?\nLeBRON JAMES:   Obviously it was back and forth, big play after big play.  A couple, you know, questionable calls that swayed their way and put Jimmy to the free-throw line.  Obviously, we can't do that.  He's been damn near perfect at the free-throw line in the series.\nWe just needed to get one stop.  We felt like if we could get one stop, we could do something on the offensive end.  But we got a hell of a look.  We got a hell of a look to win the game, to win the series.  Didn't go down.  And then we got the offensive rebound, we turned the ball over.  I thought we had a lot more time than I think we even thought after the offensive rebound, and a pass wasn't executed as we would like.\nBut we've got to be better.  We've just got to be better in Game 6 and close the series.\nQ. You've obviously been on the other side of this coming back from a 3-1 deficit.  Is there something about that experience that helps you understand what it will take to slam the door on Miami now that it's been somewhat left ajar for them?\nLeBRON JAMES:   Listen, at the end of the day, you don't predetermine anything and you take the game as it's going and you play. You play each quarter, you play each possession and you live with the results.  You don't think about what could happen at the end of the game and things of that nature.  You don't get caught up in the aftermath.  You have to live in the moment and prepare yourself each and every possession, because if you start to wander and your mind starts to go, you make a mistake.  One thing about this team that we are playing, they make you pay for every mistake.  It's the same as when I was playing against Golden State all those years, you make a mistake, they make you pay.  So we have to understand that.\nQ. Two vets, Danny and Markieff were involved in that play.  Is that a situation where you talk to them after a game like this or do you feel they have experience and they kind of know what it is and they will come ready for Game 6?\nLeBRON JAMES:   I mean, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re vets.  They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re vets.  I don't think too much need to be said to them.  I believe they will be much better and I'm not saying they even played bad tonight.  Everybody in the lineup tonight that got minutes gave the effort.  We just had some mental breakdowns at times, and they make you pay for it, like I said.  We've got to look at the film tomorrow and see how we can be better.\nQ. From I think 2:52 remaining to 0:46 remaining, you and Jimmy went back and forth; there was six straight possessions where one of you scored for your team.  And even with the questionable calls, you talked about Jimmy and his competitive nature, something that you relish.  Can you take us inside what it's like being in that battle with the game on the line?\nLeBRON JAMES:   That's the beauty of the game, being able to compete at the highest level.  You take those opportunities and you live in the moment.  You're trying to make plays for your team and be successful on both ends, and we were both just trying to do that and trying to will our team to a victory.  You know, he was able to make one more play than I was able to make tonight and come away with a victory.\nQ. Talking about calls, not trying to get you in trouble, but just from your vantage point on the last foul that got Jimmy to the line, AD looked like he went straight up.  What did you see from your vantage point?  I know you didn't have a challenge but what was it like from your view.\nLeBRON JAMES:   I thought AD made a heck of a play at the rim.  I felt he was chest to chest with Jimmy, making him change the trajectory of his shot and the call didn't go our way.\nI felt like, you know, at that point in time, I think it was a tough call, but they made the call.  We still had an opportunity to win. But we feel like, you know, with AD and with him at the rim and him contesting things like that, it could have swayed our way, but it didn't.\nQ. You talk about focus being so crucial down the stretch, AD seemed to hurt that left foot a little bit.  For you, is it tough in that moment when you're trying to figure out, you know, what can I do with him, what can't I do with him, as he's trying to fight through that?\nLeBRON JAMES:   Well, if he's on the floor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I mean he's a warrior, man.  Just him being out there, hobbled, just brings a lot more confidence to myself and our team.  We know the nicks and bumps and bruises he's played through throughout the whole season.  We have to pick it up for him and pick it up for any one of our brothers if they are hobbling or lobbying or not at their full strength.  Just the makeup of our brotherhood.\nQ. You've been in so many of these all over the years, going all the way back to throwing the ball in the corner to Donyell, Ray makes a three, Kyrie makes a three.  Tonight Danny got a great look but didn't make it.  How do you live with make or miss at this stage of a season to determine winning and losing when you've put so much into it?\nLeBRON JAMES:   I've always played the game the same way since I was a kid and I've had success doing it. And I won't let a play here or a play there change my outlook on the game and how I play the game.  I mean, if you just look at the play, I was able to draw two defenders below the free-throw line and find one of our shooters at the top of the key for a wide open three to win a championship.  I trusted him, we trusted him, and it just didn't go.  You live with that.  You live with that.\nIt's one of the best shots that we could have got, I feel, in that fourth quarter, especially down the stretch with two guys on me, Duncan Robinson and Jimmy, and Danny had a hell of a look.  It just didn't go down.  I know he wish he can have it again.  I wish I could make a better pass.  You know, but you just live with it.\n",
  "Q. We've asked you this basically every round, but close-out games you've won 16 of the last 17.  You said your mindset is about finding a way to be as desperate as the other team.  It seems like that would be so much easier said than done.  How do you find a way to do that?\nLeBRON JAMES:   Just who I am.  Just the way I prepare my mind, prepare my body, prepare for the moment.  Just having that desperation coming to a close-out game.  I've been victorious after having that mindset.  But that's just who I've become and how I've challenged and channeled my mindset.  Living in the moment and not taking it for granted and just channeling that desperation, just knowing that the opponent and the man that's across from you has that same feeling.  That's what it is.\nQ. The Executive of the Year Award just came out and I think Rob [Pelinka] finished fifth or sixth.  We know how you guys feel about Defensive Player of the Year.  We heard what you said about MVP.  Typically, individual accolades come with great team success and you guys had it.  Do you have any idea as to why maybe it hasn't happened on this team, those individual accolades?\nLeBRON JAMES:   You'd have to ask whoever voted.\nQ. Looking at what you did this year, being I think the oldest to be a first-time assist champ and being back on this stage with a third different team -- you don't need the list.  The fan vote for MVP, I think you won pretty easily.  What has this year done for legacy? Or do you think that no matter what you do from today forward, the legacy is already kind of written?\nLeBRON JAMES:   I don't really think about it too much.  I think the story will be told how it's supposed to be told and be written how it's supposed to be written.  But I don't live my life thinking about legacy.  What I do off the floor is what means more to me than what I do on the floor. Seeing my kids on the back of a Wheaties box yesterday was one of the best moments of my life.  Seeing my mom unveil the box back in my hometown of Akron, Ohio, yesterday was some of the best news, videos and pictures that I've ever seen, that I could ever get.\nThe game of basketball will pass me by.  There will be a new group of young kids and vets and rookies throughout the course of this game.  So I can't worry about that as far as on the floor.  How I move, how I walk, what I preach, what I talk about, how I inspire the next generation is what matters to me the most.  And if you appreciate my game, then cool.  If you didn't, then that's cool, too.\nThat's what it boils down to.\nQ. You guys are going to wear the Black Mamba uniforms tomorrow.  I want to know if you recall the first time seeing them either when the Lakers wore them a couple seasons ago or when you first got your hands on it.  And you are a guy who has aesthetic opinions.  What did you think about that look?\nLeBRON JAMES:   I thought they were cool from what I saw when they wore them a few years ago.  Obviously, until you get your hands on them, you don't get to see the detail in them.  It's super-duper detailed.  It has that snake Mamba print on it.  It means something. Something more than just a uniform.  It represents an individual who gave the franchise 20 years of his blood, sweat and tears and his dedication to his craft, both on and off the floor, to make that franchise be proud of him, and hopefully vice versa.\nI think last year we got a Shaq jersey.  Magic did one, as well.  I think it's just pretty cool when you know you're wearing a uniform that a legend had his hands on.\nQ. The fact that you're potentially one win away from going home and being reunited with a lot of people that you want to see and care about, does it make it harder to kind of prepare the same way for this game than any of the others?\nLeBRON JAMES:   Absolutely not.  Absolutely not.  I have a support system at home that's taking care of that and that allows me to focus on my job.  So when I get home, I get home.  But I've got a job to do.\nQ. You've talked about AD so much during this run, but I'm curious about the relationship pre-2018.  I think it was December of 2018, you mentioned to Dave about how it would be amazing to play with him.  You've talked about 2012 in the Olympics.  What was the evolution of the two of you between that time, and when did you decide, in terms of possible partners to do this thing, that this was the guy that you wanted to be with?\nLeBRON JAMES:   First of all, you just look at his one year at Kentucky and what he was able to produce for that program in one year. His ability to outrun guards, ball-handling with the smalls, block shots, catch lobs.  I remember one game, I think they were playing North Carolina and he had the game-winning block.  He had the game-winning block, I believe it was versus John Henson if I'm not mistaken, if my basketball mind is correct. That block was incredible, and they won that game. Then you just look at his run throughout that whole March Madness.  He was just beyond the best player in college basketball.\nWe get to [the Olympics in] 2012 when he's a young Anthony Davis, and he soaked up everything.  He was not a rookie that came in and thought he knew it all or felt like he was who he was, the National Player of the Year and national champion and so on and so on.  He came in with a sponge mentality right off the bat, just soaking up everything from myself, Kobe, D-Wade, Melo, so on and so on and so on.  You knew right then how great of a kid, how great of a player he was going to be just from that.\nI mean, in '18, I guess it was known; don't need to be said.  You look at a guy who can do everything out on the floor versus anybody, and you have visions of what that could look like if you were to team up.\nYeah, I was speaking just true from the heart and from a basketball mindset. Dave paid for it, I paid for it, for that moment.  But I didn't care, because I just know how special he is.\nQ. You've been a Laker now for two and a half calendar years.  I'm wondering what you've learned in that time about what it means to be part of this franchise.  And then the second is, could you share a little bit of how your relationship with Jeanie has evolved over the last couple years?\nLeBRON JAMES:   Well, one, what I've learned being a Laker is that the Laker faithful don't give a damn what you've done before. Until you become a Laker, you've got to do it with them, as well.  They don't care about your resume at all until you become a Laker.  Then you've got to do it as a Laker, and then they respect you.  I've learned that.\nMy relationship with Jeanie I will say is incredible.  I think she's an unbelievable owner.  I think she's a powerful woman.  I think what she believes in is an extension of her father, and continuing to build this legacy of this great franchise.  I'm just happy to be a part of it.  I'm happy to have the relationship that I have with her and with Linda Rambis, as well.  It's very unique.  I'm just honored to be a part of it.  I love the history of the game and I've read so much about Dr. Buss and his teams and his success.  To be playing while his daughter is the owner of the team I think is pretty cool.  It just adds to the legacy of this franchise.\nQ. I wanted to go back to the uniforms just real quick.  Did the decision to wear those tomorrow for Game 5, was that something that came from the locker room?  Did the players have a say in that?  Were you consulted on whether it was the right time to wear those again?\nLeBRON JAMES:   No, I have no idea where it came from.  I saw on the schedule it was prepared for Game 7, so I don't know where it came from.  I'll wear any uniform, to be honest.  Just put me on the court.\nQ. As you remember when this thing started in the bubble, you were talking about how difficult it can be and was to play without fans.  You spoke at length about that.  And then separately you were just saying how rough it was to live in the bubble day to day.  I'm wondering for both things, when and sort of how you got over it or got through it.  How you were able to get over playing without that usual adrenaline rush of the crowd, and when you were able to get your own mind around life in the bubble.\nLeBRON JAMES:   I don't know.  I don't know the exact date.  I think it's with anything in life.  Something that's different, something that's challenging, something that's uncomfortable.  I guess it would be like when I went from the eighth grade to the ninth grade, from middle school to high school.  It was uncomfortable, but I got used to it.  Or when you guys went to college, for the people that went to college, it was probably uncomfortable leaving home for the first time.  Not having your mom and dad's cooking or whatever the case may be, and now you're in a dorm room trying to figure this out.  But you figure it out.\nIt's human.  It's just human growth.  It's a human mindset.  It's a growth mindset.  You just figure it out.  I kept the main thing the main thing, and everything else took care of itself.  You control what you can control.  What you cannot control, you don't worry about.\nQ. Can you talk about just the social justice movement that's taking place, how guys have used their platform here, and as it comes to an end, where do you guys go from here?\nLeBRON JAMES:   We know that being here has given us the strength and the numbers.  You could take that from the Golden State Warriors: There's strength in numbers.  That's a byproduct of us being here, of being able to use this platform to be able to talk about everything that's going on outside of the court.  All the social injustice and the voter suppression and so many other things that are just going on, the police brutality and so on and so on and so on.  Being here and having the opportunity to talk about these issues and continuing to understand that this world is not just about basketball, even though we live in a small piece of the game of basketball.  There are so many bigger things and so many greater things going on.  If you can make an impact or you can make a change or you can have a vision, it just helps out so much not only in your community but all over the world.\nWhere do we go from here?  We don't stop.  Obviously, when the season ends in less than a week, everyone disperses and goes back. But I hope people continue to use their platform.  Use their individual social media platforms, if they're doing it that way, or if you are an individual that goes into your community and does it that way.  However you can continue to create change for the better of all of us, it only makes us all better.  It doesn't matter what race you are, it doesn't matter what color you are, no matter how tall or whatever the case may be, because we all want to see better days.  No matter if you agree or don't agree with some of the things that are going on, I think we'd all love to see better days and see more love than hate.\nI know I do my part, as much as I do, on continuing to create change, continuing to educate, continuing to enlighten my community and communities all over the world that listen to me and follow me throughout my journey.  Like I said, you control what you can control, and what you can't, sometimes as much as it hurts, you just try not to worry about it.\n",
  "Q. Just wanted to ask you about KCP down the stretch.  You grabbed a rebound off Jimmy's miss, pushed in transition, see him in the corner.  All the teammates you've had, you know which guys are going to be capable for those moments in a Finals game.  What do you think of his effort overall?\nLeBRON JAMES:   At the end of the day, if you're on the floor at crunch time, then I believe in you.  Whoever is out on the floor with me, I believe can make plays, and tonight was a case in point of KCP.  Stays ready.  He works on his craft.  Like you said, that three in front of their bench was a huge three, and obviously the drive at the end of the shot clock was two big back-to-back plays in the fourth quarter, where we needed to continue to score versus this team.\nQ. I think it was after Game 2 that you made the comment that it's not just enough to win the game, you guys want to be great.  This game was one where defensively you were great, and then there was a lot of sloppiness early offensively with the turnovers.  I'm just wondering if there's a certain point where you stop striving for that winning in a great way, and it's just enough to get the wins?  Or is that not until the fourth win?\nLeBRON JAMES:   It's kind of two different things, two different points you're making.  You never stop striving to be perfect or be great.  And you know that a perfect game is not going to happen, but that don't mean you still don't strive to be as great as you can be every night.\nNow, every game has its own adjustments and things of that nature, and tonight was one of those games where we had to win on the defensive end and make some timely shots.  But I think when you start thinking like, okay, well, I can't be great tonight or we can't be great tonight, okay, we just have to figure it out, then you sell yourself short.  Me personally, I would never do that as long as I lace them up and put on a uniform.  But I love what we did tonight.\nQ. You guys took a five-point lead to the fourth quarter and won the game, which made you as a team 56-0 this season taking a lead into the fourth.  What does that say about the makeup of your team, and do you take any pride in being on a team that can possess that stat?\nLeBRON JAMES:   I think the fourth quarter, obviously it's winning time.  You've got 12 minutes to buckle down defensively with the lead, kind of hold that lead, and then you have to execute offensively.  Obviously, I didn't know the stat coming into tonight.  But for us, that's just the mindset.  We've got 12 minutes.  If we have the lead, it's our job to outscore the opponent or to hold them to [as many] points as us, which is the same exact thing, because if we win the quarter, we win the game. That's kind of been our mindset all year long.\nQ. I know you talked about AD's great games and that that's who AD is, but in the last two days, from where he sort of told us after Game 3 he felt like he could have been more aggressive, to the guy he was after hitting that shot, 39 seconds left, beating his chest, what did you see in him getting back to that place where he be the player that he can be?\nLeBRON JAMES:   He's a big shot-maker late in the shot clock, early in the shot clock, fourth quarter, first quarter, everything in between.  It was just a great set up by Do [Rajon Rondo].  The possession before that, Do was able to fake it like he was going back to him, carry himself into the lane and get a layup.  And then the very next possession, he was able to find him and AD just kind of stared at the shot clock, knew it was late in the shot clock and obviously trusted his shot that he works on consistently.\nSo big-time shot, big-time play for our team to be able to put the game away.\nQ. This game, being tied back and forth the entire time, came down to moments of truth.  You guys won more than they did at the end of the day.  When AD hits that shot, and you're doing the Ric Flair and screaming, is there a different kind of satisfaction, when y'all are so tight all night long and you have a breakthrough at that point?\nLeBRON JAMES:   You kind of know momentum plays and momentum shots, the score and the time, what's going on within the last few possessions.  They were going back and forth with us, and we were going back and forth with them.  Duncan Robinson hits one off the glass at the end of the shot clock for a three.  Bam hits one off the glass right there before that we thought possibly went out; obviously it didn't count.  Herro hit some big shots.  Me and Do had a clean rebound, we're both going for it and we smash each other in the paint.  They kick it out to Jae Crowder and he hits a shot.\nTo be able to get some stops and then make a timely shot, up six, you know if you make that shot, that three to put you up nine at that point in time of the game, then you know that you want to get one more stop obviously, but you have the time on your side because it's a three-possession game with 39 seconds.  Most veteran ballclubs will be able to survive that. Just a big-time play, big-time moment not only for AD but for our ballclub and our franchise.\nQ. What does an extra day of rest mean in a very physical series like this, and does it matter more to you now than it used to?\nLeBRON JAMES:   No.  I mean, for me, it doesn't matter.  I can go every other day if that's the case.  But I'm going to take full advantage of it.  Gives me an opportunity to continue to get my body right, my mind, everything in between.  I'll take full advantage of it, but it does nothing for me besides just getting a little extra day -- I guess it does.  I guess it does do some, but it's not needed for me personally.\nQ. I believe it's like the third game of this series where you guys have called for a challenge in the first half.  You got it overturned, the right call.  How do you weigh the pros and cons of doing it so early?\nLeBRON JAMES:   There's certain momentum plays throughout the first half.  There's a certain rhythm that you have either offensively or defensively that if that call is made correctly, then you continue to stay in that zone.  You continue to stay in that rhythm.  And if the call is wrong, it can throw you off of your rhythm.\nSo we've wanted to challenge some things in the first half that we just felt like, okay, even if we were right, maybe that's not the time; we've still got our rhythm, we're good, whatever the case may be.  But we felt like in that particular moment, we were playing some really good basketball.  We were defending at a high level, and we knew for sure, we knew 100 percent, because I was guarding the ball, I knew for sure I didn't touch the ball.  Herro tried to float it over me and it hit the backboard, then hit the wire.\nCoach is always kind of like, you know, 50/50 about it, and obviously as a player on the floor, you hate to tell your coach to challenge when you're not 100 percent.  But I was for sure 100 percent about that play.\nQ. You mentioned the fourth quarter being winning time.  You played just about every second of the fourth quarter in this series.  Given the score, are you predetermined you're going to play all 12 minutes?  And what is it about the fourth quarter and your sense of urgency that might be a little different than the previous three quarters?\nLeBRON JAMES:   For me, I mean, at this point in the season, I don't care about rest.  I really don't.  I don't care about sleep.  I don't care about resting throughout the game.  Obviously, I come out of the game.  Coach has a rhythm and rotation that we live by and we go by.  But I don't care about resting because I can rest in a week, max, if it happens to go there.  I could rest for a month straight, which I won't do because of who I am; you guys know that.  But I can rest then.  I can sleep eight hours and get up and eat and then go right back to sleep if I want to.\nQ. KCP and Markieff both talked about a text that you sent that this was a must-win game.  What was it about today that prompted you to do that?\nLeBRON JAMES:   When I woke up from my nap this morning after our team meeting, I just felt that.  I felt that vibe.  I felt that pressure.  I felt like for me personally, this was one of the biggest games of my career.  I just wanted to relay that message to my teammates, the type of zone I was in, the type of moment it was, and the kind of team we were playing against.  After the Game 3 win, that confidence they had, the confidence they still have even after tonight's loss.  They are just a gritty, so damn-well-coached team.\nI feel like if we're going to be a championship ballclub, if we want to really be a championship team, that we got to have that same grit and that same attitude.  It was my mindset.  I'm still in it.  You can see my mind kind of working right now.\nQ. Anthony's versatility on defense is a weapon that allowed Frank to make the switch and say he can start possessions on Butler.  AD's ability to do that, and still get back to protect the rim and to still deter shots, is it kind of unmatched?\nLeBRON JAMES:   Yeah, that's why he's the Defensive Player of the Year.  We said that all year.  His ability to play one through five, guard anybody on the floor, take the challenge, not only guard on the perimeter, continue to protect the paint.  Guards drive on him.  It's hard to score on him.  You see how high Herro threw that ball up?  It went in, but he had to throw that thing up to the skyscrapers, right?  That guy can do everything defensively.  Guarding the ball, guard the post, slide his feet with guards, contest, can body up with bigs.  I mean, need I say more?\nQ. This is your 258th playoff game.  I'm wondering, how much have you come to enjoy the adjustment game to game that you have to make when you're in the playoffs, against good teams with good coaches that you know?\nLeBRON JAMES:   I think that's the best part.  That's the best part.  I get so excited -- like right now, I'm excited about our meeting tomorrow watching film and breaking that down and seeing things that we can do better.  Seeing things that we did do well.  Thinking about the adjustments that they possibly or will do, because I know Spo going into Game 5.  That's the best part about it.  It's a chess match.\nWhen you get to this point in your career, having your mind at a high level is so much more than the physical because we're all -- at this point, we're all great players.  We're all here for a reason.  We're in the Finals, Both conferences, anybody that is on the floor, they are on the floor for a reason.\nTo be able to think through the game and understand and see the adjustments and try to make plays before plays even seem like they are going to be possible, that's the best part for me personally.\n",
  "Q. Just wondering what stood out the most to you when you went through the film last night?\nLeBRON JAMES:   Our turnovers.  Our turnovers really killed us.  We understand that we can't turn the ball over versus this team.  We also had some breakdowns defensively throughout the course of the game that we're not accustomed to having.  Those will be cleaned up in Game 4.\nQ. You guys have responded pretty well after losses in the playoffs so far.  I'm wondering if there's a common theme between those different times, and are you seeing that same kind of mentality now?\nLeBRON JAMES:   We're able to take a loss and understand why we lost. Understand things that we should have done better and things that we can apply to the next game to be better.  We're right back at that moment once again with the opportunity to be better than we were in the game before.\nLook forward to the opportunity tomorrow night.\nQ. Specifically with Anthony, when he's had off nights or what have you, he's always responded in a really big way.  He's talked about you always kind of knowing how to approach him after a night when he's struggled.  What's your approach been with him today and what do you expect from him tomorrow?\nLeBRON JAMES:   I expect him to be AD.  I'm looking forward to getting out on the floor with him once again tomorrow night.\nQ. You've been in the Finals 10 times now.  You've been up in series, you've been down in series.  What's it like to process the time off in between games coming off a loss?\nLeBRON JAMES:   Pretty much the same coming off a win for me.  Until the series is completed, I kind of stay on edge, stay locked in on the job at hand.  Obviously, no one wants to ever lose.  You hate that feeling, especially when you know you didn't play your best, and I definitely wasn't at my best last night from an individual standpoint.  So I take that responsibility and I take that with a lot of passion and understanding of how I can be much better in the following game.\nThroughout the postseason, I stay even keel.  As I've grown in this game and I've grown over the years, I kind of stay even keel, understanding that there's always another opportunity to get better.  We have that opportunity today and also tomorrow night in the game.\nQ. You're wearing a \"More Than a Vote\" shirt right now. In terms of trying to influence change, thinking back eight years ago when you wore those hoodies as a statement of Trayvon Martin, what are the biggest things you've learned about impacting change off the court?  Is there advice you now would have given yourself eight years ago when you kind of started this journey?\nLeBRON JAMES:   That you can't get caught up in what everybody else thinks, because everyone is not going to always agree with your movement.  Everyone is not going to agree with your words.  Everyone is not going to agree with your passion.  Everyone is not going to always agree with why you're doing it, things of that nature.  If you're true to it and it hits home and it hits the heart, then it shouldn't matter.  And it doesn't, because you have the knowledge and you have the passion and you have the support to be able to shed light on situations that you feel are either unjust or wrong.\nThere's a thing called common sense.  You know the difference between right and wrong.  It's something I've always grew up on.  My mother always told me [about] being able to understand the difference between right and wrong and noticing it and being able to have that feeling.  To sit back and think eight years ago when we sat in Detroit in the ballroom as a part of the Miami Heat team, and we all decided to put our hoodies on in a reflection, in a remembrance of Trayvon Martin and that tragic incident, we knew that it was going to be uncomfortable to a lot of people.  But we didn't care, because we understood how much it hit home for us and a lot of our guys having sons of their own.  We could imagine if our kid was to leave home and not return.  I think that's what it boils down to.\nQ. In terms of talking to opponents on the floor, are you a guy who just responds to trash talk?  Do you initiate it?  As your status has moved up in the league, has it changed?  Have different players said different things or do they not want to talk to you because they don't want to get you going?  How does that equation go?\nLeBRON JAMES:   No, I've always been a guy who kind of let his game do the talking.  But when guys get to talking, I can do that, as well.  I've always tried to let my game do the talking.\nSome guys like to talk their way through the basketball game.  I think it helps them out personally.  There's always communication going on on the floor.  For me personally, as long as it doesn't get disrespectful, I'm fine with it.\nBut I've never really started up a trash-talking dialogue.  That's just not me.  I believe the way I play the game is enough trash talking in itself.\nQ. From just a strategy standpoint, Bam is the type of big who is obviously a really great playmaker but he doesn't space the floor so much with his shooting.  The guys that Miami plays at the position now, Meyers and Olynyk, both do.  How much different does that force you guys to be defensively?  You talked about those defensive breakdowns last night.  I imagine spacing had something to do with a couple of them.\nLeBRON JAMES:   I think it all boils down to, no matter who's in the lineup for those guys, they're a great team. It's just that simple.  They're going to put you in positions that may feel uncomfortable, that will be uncomfortable, throughout the course of 48 minutes, and we have to be able to adjust.  There's things that Meyers and Kelly do that Bam doesn't do, but we also understand that there's things Bam does that not too many guys in this league can do.  They create different challenges depending on who's out on the floor.\nWhen there's five guys out on the floor for the Miami Heat, they're going to play how they play.  They're going to move the ball, they're going to move with pace, they're going to share the ball.  They've got guys that can get into the paint.  They've got guys that can shoot threes.  They've got guys that command double teams and things of that nature.  It doesn't matter who's out on the floor for them; they're going to be playing at a high level because that's just the way they are.  They're extremely well-coached from top to bottom.\nQ. You've always prided yourself on playing the right way.  You still have those moments like the fourth quarter against Denver in the close-out game where you're like, this is going to end now and you go to that place.  Jimmy parallels you in that regard in that he doesn't want to have the ball in his hands every possession; he wants to get other guys involved.  And then you saw last night what he ends up doing.  Are you in that space yet where you think you might have to go that tack to close this thing out and go to that fourth-quarter-Bron-against-Denver mode, like we've seen so many times from you in the past?  Or are you not there yet?\nLeBRON JAMES:   I've never predetermined my game plan throughout my whole career.  I've never gone into a game saying, okay, I need to score 40 tonight, I need to dominate in the scoring facet, things of that nature, I need to make big shots.  I've never predetermined my game.  Throughout my whole life, I've never done that.  One thing I've always been, I've always been prepared.  If you're prepared, then whatever the game -- however the course happens, you're able to make adjustments throughout the game and you're able to impact the game because you're prepared and you've put in the work.  It's just that simple for me.\nI think anytime I've ever thought about, okay, I'm going to try to go out and do this, it doesn't happen that way.  The game has too many things that can happen throughout the course of the game and throughout the course of a quarter or possessions here and possessions there where you can try to plan for it, but audibles happen in the football sense.\nThe best thing I can tell you is that I'm always prepared and I know that I've put in the work.  I trust that.\nQ. Early in the pandemic you mentioned that your body was kind of in shock, that you were rounding toward third base for the playoffs and then you had to stop.  All these months later, how would you say your body has responded to all that?\nLeBRON JAMES:   I'm in great shape.  I bounce back extremely well in between games.  I could play right now if we had to play right now, at a high level.\n",
  "Q. Was there anything that you noticed in that first quarter about just the general way the team was playing and the turnovers that surprised you, and how did that play out for the rest of the game?\nLeBRON JAMES:   We know that we can't turn the ball over versus this team.  They are very active defensively.  It starts with myself, being the starting point guard of the team, having five first-half turnovers, eight total for the game. Can't do that, obviously, because it gives them more possessions and doesn't allow us to set our defense.  They are really, really good offensively, so you just can't turn the ball over against that team. I take full responsibility for that.\nQ. You've had a 40-point triple-double in the Finals before.  Just wondered what you thought of Jimmy's effort tonight and how you need to defend him better or differently in Game 4.\nLeBRON JAMES:   I thought Jimmy was phenomenal.  He did everything that they needed him to do tonight and he came through big time in a big-time game.  We'll watch film and see ways we can be better going into Game 4.  But I thought he was great.\nQ. Anthony got into foul trouble early and had trouble getting going.  What did you see happening with him?\nLeBRON JAMES:   I mean, you just said it, he got into some foul trouble.  You know, they even -- one of the shots he made when he had four fouls, they still tried to slide underneath him and get him a fifth in the third.  I think the foul trouble made him a little passive, because he wanted to be out on the floor but he couldn't be his aggressive self offensively and defensively.  I think the fouls slowed him down a lot tonight.\nQ. Despite seemingly Miami controlling the action, holding the lead for most of the start of the game, you guys took a lead around nine minutes to go in the fourth quarter.  From there on, what do you think allowed them to separate from you guys?\nLeBRON JAMES:   They continued to make shots, and we had some turnovers.  We didn't make shots.  They came out and executed after we took the lead.  Jimmy, like I said, he had his hand on all those plays pretty much.\nObviously, we have to do a better job of that coming down the stretch.  But I like our fight tonight, even as poorly as I believe we played.\nQ. You guys obviously had a chance to take a 3-0 lead.  Are you concerned about giving Miami a breath of fresh air?  And with the possibility of Bam returning in the next game, do you feel like an opportunity missed that way?\nLeBRON JAMES:   When you have an opportunity and you don't make the most of it, then you come back the next time.  I mean, it's not like the series was over if we won tonight.  We know for sure that Miami is never going to quit, no matter if we won tonight and they go into a Game 4, 3-0.  I know how resilient that bunch is and how resilient that coaching staff is and their franchise.  I don't ever feel like we let our guard down.  Also, I don't feel like we're concerned.  We're not concerned.  We know we can play a lot better.  We have another opportunity to take a commanding lead on Tuesday.  You relish that opportunity.\nQ. When you guys have lost games this postseason, you've responded very well.  What is it about this group that's handled quick adjustments that has bounced back from losses so well in these playoffs?\nLeBRON JAMES:   We learn from our mistakes pretty quick.  You know, obviously right now with the games being every other day pretty much, it's the film room.  It's the film room and it's how well we can make adjustments from the film and take it to the floor, and we have done a great job throughout this postseason.  So we are going to definitely have to do that because we're playing against a very, very, very, very good team.  We have to learn from our mistakes and be better on Tuesday.\nQ. It's usually pretty fun when you and Jimmy play against each other over the years.  Would you say that you enjoy playing against him?  You respect playing against him?  Where is your level and emotions toward him as you go against him over and over, different teams, different cities?\nLeBRON JAMES:   Love it.  Love it.  One of the best competitors we have in our game.  We love that opportunity.  For me personally, I don't know how many more opportunities I'm going to have, so to be able to go against a fierce competitor like that is something I'll look back on when I'm done playing.  I'll miss those moments.\nQ. When you walked off the court with about ten seconds left, was that frustration or did you think the game was over?\nLeBRON JAMES:   Both.\nQ. Would you say tonight's loss was more about effort or execution or a combination of the two?\nLeBRON JAMES:   I just think we can be better, obviously.  I don't think we started the game defensively in tune, and then offensively taking care of the ball.  Like I said, we had some careless turnovers.  It starts with me, like I said, and I take full responsibility for that.  I'll be a lot better on Tuesday with that, understanding that they are very good with their hands.  They are very good with the stripping.  You can't allow this team to have extra possessions.  You can't turn the ball over at that high a rate, especially at this point in the season, as well.\nI'll be a lot better with the security of the ball and the turnovers and things of that nature.  We as a team will be a lot better defensively with our game plan.\n",
  "Q. I believe you would have just finished your junior year in high school, 2002, Kobe and Shaq both go for 30-plus against the Nets, Game 3 of the Finals.  You were drafted the next year.  You and AD, first time Lakers teammates have done that since then.  Wondered your thoughts on the Kobe-Shaq dynamic and what it's like going through a game like today with AD, especially at a similar level of efficiency.\nLeBRON JAMES:   You know, obviously being in high school, watching the Kobe-Shaq duo was the most dominant duo that I have personally seen in my life from a basketball perspective.  Obviously we knew the force that Shaq brought to the table, but the elegance and force that Kobe played with, as well. They were very dominant in what they did on the floor, on both sides of the floor.  So to be in the conversation with those two guys, myself and Anthony, myself and AD -- he's going to kill me -- myself and AD, is just very humbling, because I know I grew up watching those guys.  I grew up admiring Kobe; obviously, a kid coming straight out of high school.  Admired that, as a kid when I was young, and obviously got the opportunity.  And the force that Shaq played with.  It's very humbling that we can be even mentioned with those greats.\nQ. AD and Frank indicated that even though it's a win, they were not totally happy with how things went defensively, especially Frank had mentioned that.  Do you agree, and if so, what concerns you?\nLeBRON JAMES:   I definitely agree.  Myself, Coach and AD were not happy with our defensive presence tonight.  We know we can be a lot better and we're just, myself and AD, we're not satisfied with just the win.  We want to be great.  We want to be great, as close to 48 minutes as possible.\nI know I said it after Game 1, but I'm extremely excited to watch the film tomorrow, as well as a group, to see ways we can be better.  We're playing against a very dangerous team in Miami, where they have five guys on the floor that's a threat, as they have shown tonight.\nSo we have to continue to stay on our P's and Q's and cross our T's and dot our I's throughout the course of a game, and if we have a breakdown, being able to cover for one another.  But they do a great job of putting your defense in positions that you may not be accustomed to.\nWe definitely were not happy with our performance defensively tonight. Hopefully we can be -- well, we know, not hopefully, we know we can be better in Game 3.\nQ. Shaq's a big post presence, a five as much as a five can be.  Kobe, perimeter, all that.  You and AD seem to have elements maybe of a bit of both of their games.  I don't know if you would agree with that, but if you do, could you describe how maybe both of you are a bit of a hybrid of what those guys brought to the court?\nLeBRON JAMES:   Well, I guess if you look in the sense of the size and the power and the speed that Shaq at his size played with, you could look at my game throughout the course of my career and say that.  And then you look at the elegance and the ability to shoot the ball and the ability to play in the paint as well as post up and get to the perimeter, I guess you can say that you can have some of AD's game that could compare to Kobe's game in that sense.\nObviously, all four of us are all different positions.  Kobe was a natural 2-guard.  I'm kind of a, I don't know, whatever position.  Shaq is a center. AD is kind of a hybrid, as well.  But I guess all four of us, we have a winning mentality and we just tried to make enough plays out on the floor throughout the course of the game that would benefit not only ourselves individually but for the most important thing, for the better of the team.\nI can't even believe I'm up here talking about myself and AD with Kobe and Shaq.\nQ. After the Heat timeout with UD, it seemed like there was a turn in momentum and they started attacking aggressively.  What do you know about UD that makes him impactful to a bench of players like that, even though he himself is not playing in the game?\nLeBRON JAMES:   Check his r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9.  It's that simple.  I mean, he's put in the work.  He's been there through everything that the Heat franchise has seen.  He's seen it all, done it all.  Just check his r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9.  There's not many guys that talk about it and also be about it, and he's one of them.  If you want to be in the foxhole, that's somebody you want to be in the foxhole with.\nQ. You used the word \"force\" probably six or seven times in the first two answers today.  How important has your team's ability to play with force made a difference in these first two games?\nLeBRON JAMES:   I think I was talking about force because Shaq's name came up.  There's no way that you can talk about Shaq and not have that word come up.  From the team's perspective, I think we've done a good job of, one, not turning the ball over, but also still being able to play with force, as you would say.  Play with tempo offensively, get good looks. Get good looks that we like and, make or miss, live with the results.  We have to play with that type of force defensively, but also from the cerebral side, as well.  Thinking the game a little bit better as they are going through their offense and their pace and their force, as well.  We've got to be a lot better obviously on that side.\nQ. When you guys advanced past Denver, Frank was talking about the relationship he has with you, and he said that the buy-in that you had with him as a coach and the immediacy of that buy-in did a lot for this team and where you are right now.  What was it about Frank that gave that you immediate buy-in and that you gravitated toward?\nLeBRON JAMES:   For one, from a competitive standpoint, going against Frank's teams in Indiana when we had our battles and I was in Miami, you understood how well those teams were coached.  It starts with the head coach, and the players are an extension of the head coach.\nSo I had that memory of that, just battling those Indiana Pacers teams.  And then for me, I've always been a coachable player throughout my whole life.  I've played for multiple coaches and I've always been a coachable player.\nSo you know, the respect, more importantly, he's the head coach.  The head coach should have the respect from all his players, no matter who you are, if you're really serious about trying to make an impact or really trying to do something special.  It was just that simple for me personally.\n",
  "Q. Just wondered over the course of your career what's your approach when your opponent is missing a couple of key players?  What's the message to relate to your team?\nLEBRON JAMES:   Keep the same thing the same thing.  You prepare for whoever is out on the floor.  There's going to be five guys in opposing jerseys on the floor, and they're all dangerous, no matter who's in the lineup, no matter what the name is.  You have to approach it like they all can beat you as a unit, and as individuals they're on the floor for a reason.  We understand that.  We will have a game plan, no matter who's out on the floor.  But that's not for us to worry about.  For us to worry about is how we approach the game coming into Game 2 and how we continue to work our habits and try to be as great as we can be throughout 48 minutes.\nQ. In what ways have you benefited from all these Finals appearances in terms of what it's meant to have the game's best coaches kind of expose any weaknesses and nitpick at your game?  What coaches that you've faced on this stage have had the biggest influence on your improvements?\nLEBRON JAMES:   Like I mentioned last night, the best teacher is life experience.  I've played against great coaches throughout my whole career, not only in the regular season but in the postseason, throughout first, second, third, Finals runs.  I've played against some exceptional coaches, great coaches, Hall of Fame coaches, Hall of Fame players.  They've all, opponents and coaches, helped me get to this point where I am today, to a point where I have no weakness, offensively or defensively, to where if I can read a defense, I can exploit it.  I can put myself in a position to be successful.  It doesn't mean that the ball goes in all the time, but there's nothing out on the floor that I cannot do at this point in my career.  That's all because of the competition and the adversity and the losses and everything I've been through throughout the course of my career.  At that point in time I say I've got to work on this because that's what they're allowing me to have; now I've got to work on this because they're shutting this down in my game.  It's just, like I said, the best teacher in life is life experience, and I've experienced it all.\nQ. Last night you were so excited to get back into the film and just go over what had happened in Game 1.  How late did you stay up watching last night, and then today have you guys gotten together at all to watch film?  And then also I was wondering what your biggest takeaways were from that review.\nLEBRON JAMES:   I stayed up until about 4:00, 4:30 in the morning last night breaking down the film individually, watching the same things that we did throughout the course of the game, seeing ways we were great, seeing ways we were not so great, and a lot of them were things that we can control.  We're playing against an exceptional basketball team, obviously, great coached.  So we have to continue to understand that coming into Game 2.  It was great to get with the guys today earlier and go over the film, and like I said, see things that we can do a lot better, both offensively and defensively.\nThey're going to make adjustments in Game 2, and we need to be ready for that.  We can't come out with the energy that we had in Game 1 and go down 23-10 and expect the same result as we had in Game 1.  So we look forward to that challenge.\nQ. What's it like going up against a guy like Jae Crowder, who you had playoff battles when he was in Boston, then you were teammates, and now here you are going against one another again with the Finals on the line and having some physical moments in Game 1?\nLEBRON JAMES:   It was like every other individual I went against in this playoff run.\nQ. We talk about your leadership and how much you're able to help teach your teammates.  What does that look like during the regular season versus during the Finals?\nLEBRON JAMES:   I think for me, it's all about how you approach being a professional.  That's both on and off the floor, how you show up to work, how you walk, how you move, how you prepare.  It's not all about just talking about it.  It's how you be about it as well.  You don't get to pick two or three days out of the week where you want to be a leader or you say I want it to be Monday, Wednesday, Friday.  No, it's an everyday thing, both on the court and off the court.\nI try to lead by example.  I lead by my voice as well.  But I put the work in.  I think my guys see how much I put the work in, and they allow me to lead them.  I respect them for that.  I'm humbled by that as well.\nQ. Non-Finals question.  One of your rookie basketball cards bid for $1.8 million and another bid for $900,000.  Given your humble beginnings, what do you think of that when -- you're still playing, and it's not like you're Honus Wagner or Babe Ruth.  How do you take that in when somebody is paying $1.8 million for your rookie card?\nLEBRON JAMES:   I think it's pretty cool.  That's the first thing I think about when I think about where I come from, hearing those numbers -- you didn't hear those numbers much growing up, obviously, where I'm from.  And the second thing I think about is I have two rookie cards of my own, so I'll be good for a very, very long time.  No matter what happens, I'm good.\nQ. A couple days ago you talked about what's happening in the world right now, controlling what you can control.  On the voting front, the Washington Post today had a story come out saying that the players have gone from I think 22 percent to 85 percent representation.  That's you guys controlling what you can control.  How much pride do you take in that, and do you feel like that message is landing and will make a mark?\nLEBRON JAMES:   That is the hope.  That's the hope every day, that you can educate and you can get people motivated to go out and create change.  I've just tried to put not only myself but my team in position to be able to educate whoever needs it and to encourage and to empower people in our communities.  Like I say, we always talk about change in our communities: We want change, we want to see this, we want to see that.  We have the opportunity to do so.\nIt's an honor for me to be in a position where I can have a platform and I can have a support system and I can have a group of people that we can put together a plan and then execute that and give it back.  It's also very humbling as well to hear that number, that percentage go from the low 20s to the 80s.  It's something that we want to continue to grow.  Hopefully we can be in the 90s by next week and even higher and in the higher 90s by November.  We want to continue that.\nAlso had a lot of the volunteer poll workers in the virtual fan thing last night, 40 of them to be exact, and we have over 10,000 volunteers right now with More Than a Vote with the campaign that we're doing, initiative that we're doing.  Hopefully we can get 11,000 tomorrow and 12,000 and continue to grow that because it's so important.  We understand that, especially with COVID going around and not having the elderly out of their homes and doing those things, having the younger generation being able to come in and help out in such a difficult time right now with the virus that's going on still is very, very key.  Like I say, I'm proud of where we are, but we have a lot more room to go.  Hopefully we continue to do that.\nQ. I know you referenced \"Step Brothers\" the other night in relationship to Anthony.  But I want to know the common ground that you guys may share or have shared that allowed your relationship to flourish and if there's any way that he has an influence on you on the basketball court.\nLEBRON JAMES:   We're not jealous of each other.  I think that's the best thing.  In professional sports, you have guys that join forces to become alpha males.  That's what they call them.  Two guys that have been dominant in a specific sport on their own respective teams, and they get together and they talk about how dominant they can be and they talk about this is going to be this and that.\nI believe jealousy creeps in a lot.  And that is the absolute contrary of what we are.  We know who we are.  We know what we're about.  We want the best, seriously, every single day, both on and off the floor, for one another.  We're just not jealous of one another.  I think that you align that with respect, I think the sky's the limit.\nQ. To follow up on what you said about you and AD, do you feel like the ability to not be jealous of each other is sort of a natural quality or is that something that has to be learned for some guys, and what was that like for you kind of striking that balance?\nLEBRON JAMES:   I don't speak for other guys and what they -- I don't know, I just speak for myself.  For AD, I know who we are.  We respect one another.  We drive one another.  We command excellence out of one another.  And that's what it boils down to.\nJealousy and envy has killed a lot of great things, not only in sports but in general.  If you're able to just throw that to the side and throw your egos to the side but continue to bring that confidence of what you're trying to do of keeping the main thing the main thing -- not saying it's that easy, but for us it's that easy when it comes to our relationship.  Like I said, it doesn't result in wins every night.  It doesn't result in me putting up numbers or him putting up numbers every night, but as far as our brotherhood and our chemistry, that's what it boils down to.\nQ. Last night you said that you think it's easier to learn from wins than it is from losses.  I'm curious, though, how did the 2007 Finals shape the next 13 years of your career, going through that first trip and feeling that pain from that series?\nLEBRON JAMES:   Well, I mean, obviously they were the better team.  Dealing with Timmy and Manu and Tony and Pop, four Hall of Famers, I knew it would be challenging, not only for myself but for our franchise and for our ballclub.  I saw the way they approached every game, how they approached every possession.  They didn't make mistakes.  They weren't just happy with being there; they wanted to be great, as a unit and as individuals as well.\nI sensed that as a 22-year-old, and I saw that as a 22-year-old.  That helped shape me year after year after year after year, just holding on to that feeling of not being able to reach the ultimate goal.  But at the same time, like I said, just having that adversity and having those moments has put me in a position where I've been throughout my career.\nQ. When you went to the first Finals against Golden State, you lose Kyrie Irving in Game 1, you had already lost Kevin Love, then you went out and won the next couple games.  When a team is in Miami's situation now and they talk about next man up, next man up, how did you go from saying we can still do this to putting together a plan and then actually going out and doing it the next couple games?\nLEBRON JAMES:   I think every situation is different.  For us, obviously, losing Kyrie and losing Kevin in that playoff run was detrimental to our success.  We were still able to have some success, but we never fully reached the full potential of what our ballclub could be in that run.\nThat's different from -- I can't correlate that to what today is all about.  For us as a ballclub and for us as the Lakers, our mindset is Game 1 is over and Game 2 we've got to be better than we were in Game 1.  And when we approach that with that mindset and be as desperate as the opponent, then we give ourselves a good chance to win.\nQ. You guys were still able to create and sustain three separate runs despite not having those benchmark things from points in the paint and fast break points.  What did you like most about the ability to do that despite not having those weapons?\nLEBRON JAMES:   Yeah, for us the game kind of dictates itself at times.  We have to win in different ways.  We're very good at the fast break game.  We understand that.  But when we make our mark on the defensive end, when we're getting deflections, we're getting blocked shots, we're contesting shots either at the rim or at the perimeter or mid-range, things of that nature, which creates early offense for us, it doesn't always show up in the box score, but when we're active defensively, we're an extremely good team.\nEvery game is going to be its own challenge, and we understand that.  You have to win games in different fashions.  Sometimes even outside your own box.  But I think the great teams learn that throughout the course of a run, throughout the course of a season, and that's what puts them in a position to compete for a championship, which we are today.\n",
  "Q. You guys went on a 75-30 run after falling down 13 early.  What allows you guys to have success like that over a sustained period of time, a run like that?\nLeBRON JAMES:   Paying attention to detail.  I don't think in the beginning that we were physical enough.  You have to get a feel for how hard Miami plays.  I think they smacked us in the mouth, and we got a sense of that.  And so we knew how hard we had to play if we wanted to try to make it a game.\nYou know, from that moment when it was 23-10, we started to play to our capabilities.  We started flying around.  We started getting defensive stops.  We started sharing the ball a lot better offensively and just got into a really good groove.\nQ. For AD, obviously his first Finals game.  What did you see about his preparation?  Was there any advice you gave him, and to see him perform like that, what do you feel about that?\nLeBRON JAMES:   I don't feel anything.  I expect it out of him.  Didn't need to give him no advice.  We've been preparing for this moment all season.  He's been preparing for this moment all season.  I'm happy to be on the same floor with him and in the same uniform.  He was, once again, a force in every facet of the game, offensively and defensively.\nQ. You've felt the buzz of the NBA Finals nine times in your career, but what was it like today with nobody there, the sound?  I know you're used to bubble basketball at this point, but at this stage what did it feel like to play a Finals game?\nLeBRON JAMES:   Felt great.  Felt great.  I've been preparing for this moment for quite a while.  Fans, no fans, the inner challenge for myself and the way I prepare myself, it felt amazing to be playing in the Finals once again.\nQ. You've seen plenty of times over the years where if one team has a bunch of injuries, the other team floats a little bit and doesn't come at them as hard.  How do you make sure that you guys don't do that in Game 2?\nLeBRON JAMES:   We've got so much more work to do.  The job is not done.  We're not satisfied with winning one game.  It's that simple.\nQ. There was a few times where you guys got up big, and there was a lot of celebrating going on, and I see sometimes you had to rein it in a little bit.  In your experience, what have you seen in the past that got you to the point where you felt like sometimes you need to say, okay, let's keep it on task?\nLeBRON JAMES:   The best teacher in life is experience. I've experienced moments in my career where you have all the momentum in the world and you felt like you had the game under control, and one play here or one play there could change the course of a series or change the course of a game.\nOne in particular that always rings home for me is Game 2 of the 2011 Finals in Miami versus Dallas.  D-Wade hits a three right by their bench.  I believe it put us up either 13 or 17.  From that moment on, Dallas went on a hell of a run and finished it off with a Dirk Nowitzki left-hand layup to steal that game.  That (expletive) burns me to this day.\nI always talk about the best teacher in life is experience, and I've experienced a lot.  That's what prompts me to be who I am today, is being able to have those experiences.\nQ. I'm wondering in a game like this when you had the kind of lead that you had, are you already thinking, \"This is what we could do better, here are some things that we're doing wrong.\" Were you already in that frame of mind during this game?\nLeBRON JAMES:   Yeah, absolutely.  I think you can learn so much more from a win than you can in a loss.  I can't wait for tomorrow for us to get back together and watch the film and see ways we can be better and see some of the breakdowns that we had, especially in that fourth quarter, especially in that first six minutes of the first quarter where we can be so much better defensively and also so much better offensively.\nSo I can't wait.  I'm extremely amped up about watching the film with our ballclub tomorrow.  I'm going to watch some tonight obviously by myself, but I'm looking forward to getting together as a group tomorrow.\nQ. Teams have spent your whole career trying to keep you out of the paint, and you can say the same thing this season about AD.  What are some of the ways that you guys are still always seemingly able to get to the rim and still able to finish?\nLeBRON JAMES:   Because we have great spacing and great shooters.  KCP, Danny Green, Kyle Kuzma and Markieff Morris, a list of guys that can spread the floor, it allows myself and AD to be able to do the things that we do in the interior.\nWe try to mix up our game, too.  We try to mix it in in the interior and the exterior.  But when you have guys that could space the floor like we have, it allows us to do some of the things that we do in the paint.\nQ. Why is Rondo so opposed to being called Playoff Rondo, and did you see some of that in the first half especially?\nLeBRON JAMES:   I'm not sure.  I've never called him that.  We've never called him that.  We only call him Do.  So that would be a Do question.\nBut you know, just having him in this moment, having him on our side, and I think he mentioned yesterday or whenever Media Day was for the Finals, you just don't -- you never know.  You don't get these moments a lot.  It's been over a decade since he's been in the Finals.  I think he's just cherishing the moment, but also just playing the game that he loves to play -- the cerebral way, the determined way, the championship way, as he's been playing for quite a while now.\n",
  "Q. LeBron, just studying the Heat and what you've seen from them in this postseason, what's at the top of the list?  What stands out the most to you about the way that they're playing basketball?\nLeBRON JAMES:   I would think two things:  One, how hard they play for 48 minutes, no matter if they're up, no matter if they're down.  They play extremely hard.  And I think two, it would be the way they move off the ball, they share the ball.  Everyone is live on the floor.  There's not one guy that you can disrespect or be off throughout the course of an offensive possession.  And they do a hell of a job of moving without the ball, sharing the ball, cutting, passing.  Those are two things that stand out.\nQ. You've described that time in Miami like it was going to college for you.  If you can think back to those four years, what were the most important lessons you learned about yourself and about leadership in general?\nLeBRON JAMES:   I think as far as leadership, that grows no matter where you are every day, if you want to be a leader, if you strive to be a leader every day.  I think being around Riles and Spo, D-Wade and UD, just to name a few, being a part of that culture allowed me to grow, allowed me to see what it takes to not only compete for a championship but also to win a championship.  So it definitely put me in a position where I knew what it took.  I saw what it took.  But also I fit that culture as well because of how hard I worked.  It was a perfect match for those four years.\nQ. Would it have any extra meaning to you to win a championship against Pat Riley and Erik Spoelstra, guys that have helped shape you and vice versa in those years together?\nLeBRON JAMES:   Absolutely not.  It's no extra meaning to winning a championship, no matter who you're playing against.  It's already hard enough to even reach the Finals, to be in this position.  If you're able to become victorious out of the Finals, it doesn't matter who it's against.  I'm just happy that I'm here with the opportunity to represent not only myself but represent our fans, our fan base, our organization, my teammates, our coaching staff, our training staff and so many others that represent this organization to the utmost respect.\nQ. Six years after playing for Miami, how do you feel about Pat Riley?\nLeBRON JAMES:   That's such a broad question.  I don't understand.\nQ. Leaves it open for interpretation.  When you hear the name Pat Riley, what do you think about?  How do you describe your relationship --\nLeBRON JAMES:   When I hear Pat Riley, I think about one of the greatest minds probably this game has ever had.  He's won at every level.  I saw the stat the other day that he's been part of a championship in four decades.  This league is not the same without Riles.  He's a great guy, great motivator, someone that just knows what it takes to win, and he's shown that over the course of, what, 40 years.\nQ. You've talked about just sort of the difficulty of adapting to the bubble. How much have you sort of motivated yourself by reflecting that your teammates are taking cues from you and trying to see how you approach things and sort of approach getting through this grind, the three months here?\nLeBRON JAMES:   It's probably been the most challenging thing I've ever done as far as a professional, as far as committing to something and actually making it through.  But I knew when I was coming what we were coming here for.  I would be lying if I sat up here and knew that everything inside the bubble, the toll that it would take on your mind and your body and everything else, because it's been extremely tough.\nBut I'm here for one reason and one reason only, and that's to compete for a championship.  That was my mindset once I entered the bubble, once I entered the quarantine process the first two days.  Then right from my first practice, my mindset was to -- if I'm going to be here, make the most of it and see what you can do and lock in on what the main thing is.  The main thing was for us to finish the season and compete for a championship.\nSo that's just been my mindset throughout these -- I don't even know how many days it is.  However many days it is, it feels like five years.  So it really doesn't matter.  I've been as locked in as I've ever been in my career.\nQ. Back in March the season comes to an end, two players on your team test positive for this virus.  When did you think getting to this point was even a possibility?  And what was it like kind of mourning the fact that maybe it wasn't happen?\nLeBRON JAMES:   I didn't know that this was a possibility until we actually got on the plane in L.A. to fly here to Orlando.  We had seen some other teams arrive before us.  We got here July 9th.  We had seen some of the teams arrive a couple days before us.  But until we landed here, actually got off the plane, got on the bus and pulled up here to the hotel, that's when it became a reality to me.\nQ. From your vantage point, what do you think it is about Erik Spoelstra that, no matter if it's coaching No. 1 picks or a collection of undrafted/lower-drafted guys, allows him to continue to bring groups back here to the Finals, but also not necessarily always be in the conversation with that upper echelon of coaches?\nLeBRON JAMES:   Well, that's a question for you guys.  The players and the coaches know how great Spo is.  There's this narrative that Spo is not great, and the narrative that he doesn't get a lot of respect, which he should.  He prepares his team every single night.  If you watch the Miami Heat, no matter who's on the floor, they're going to play Heat culture. They're going to play hard. They're going to play together.  That's what he's always been about.  It's been you guys that have changed the narrative or has never given Spo his respect because he had D-Wade or he had myself or he had Bosh.  But a lot of coaches have talent.  A lot of coaches have had talent over the course of this league.  It's not one.\nIt's unfortunate that he hasn't gotten his respect.  Every time we talked about Spo when I was there and we talked about how great he prepared us, and we talked about how great it was playing for Spo and things of that nature, you guys always said, Well, you have LeBron, you have D-Wade, you have Bosh; any coach can do it.  No, any coach can't do it.  If any coach could do it, then there would be a lot more champions in this league.  There would be a lot more successful coaches.\nSpo likes it.  That's what fuels Spo, is the disrespect that you guys give him, the basketball world.  I'm not going to sit up here and act like I don't know what Spo is all about, because he's damned good, if not great.  Probably is great, because his preparation.  He prepares like it's his last time ever coaching again every game, and I know that.  That's why I feel good.\nQ. There is political financial data out there that shows that pro sports owners, including NBA owners, donate overwhelmingly to Republican causes.  I know they've pledged a lot of money to help with racial and social justice issues, but do you feel that those political contributions undercut some of the efforts that players are making to gain progress on those topics?\nLeBRON JAMES:   Well, one, I'm not going to give my energy to that because it's not surprising.  My mom has always told me, control what you can control, and I can't control that.  What I can control is what I'm doing on my side and trying to have people gather around me and gather around my initiatives and doing what we're doing to try to effect change, not only in our communities but outside of our communities with the youth, and let them understand how important their voice is and their vote is to our society.  It's hard as hell, because they just don't believe it.  They don't believe that their vote or their message or their minds or their voices matter.  But that's where my energy is, on continuing to push the envelope in my community, continue to let them know that they are the future, they are the reason why there will be change.  But I can't give my energy to the other side because that will take away from my people, and I can't do that.\nControl what you can control.  I can't control that. That is what it is.  It's not a surprise.  But I've got work to do on the other side.  So that's what my mission is about.\nQ. You mentioned you're as determined as ever, right now as locked in as you've ever been.  Usually during this postseason run you block out from social media.  You couldn't do it this year because you're in a bubble, away from family.  Important election coming up.  How has that adjustment been for you during this time to have access to social media?  You usually try to eliminate distractions, but you've got it right there in your hand.\nLeBRON JAMES:   Yeah, I think in this particular case, everything about this year is different.  Everything about 2020 is different, and to make the most of it, you have to be able to adjust.  I've adjusted in the sense of understanding that there's also a bigger opportunity coming up as well in November, while I'm still keeping the main thing the main thing and the focus on leaving a legacy here and playing the game that I love to play and competing for a championship.  But also letting my people know that I'm not jaded, and I'm not too distracted where I cannot continue to give the resources, put the people in place to help them go to the places where they don't believe they can even go.  Sometimes you do things that even you personally don't even believe that you can do, but when you have a support system, and you have a group around you that's just as motivated as you, you're able to tackle a few things at once.\nQ. The last couple times you were here, you were pretty outmanned by a team with four great players.  As you come back now with the team you have around you, how do you feel going into this 10th Finals now?  Do you feel like talent-wise you don't have to worry about that problem this time?\nLeBRON JAMES:   I never had a problem with any team I went to the Finals [with].  I've always been confident that we had the ability to win.  If you're going to a Finals saying you're undermanned or you feel like you don't have enough, then who are you?  The game is won between the four lines, not won on paper.  At the end of the day, when I've lost in the Finals, the better team won because they played well, they were more prepared and they did what they needed to do to win those four games.  When I've won, the same thing.\nI'm not here to talk about the talent we all have, the team that we have.  The game is won in between the four lines, 94 feet.  The team that is prepared and the team that executes, the team that is not careless throughout 48 minutes will give themselves a chance to win each and every game.  I'm confident going into this Finals, as I've always been in my career.\nQ. It's been a long time, obviously, since you played for the Heat and a lot has happened to you and to the league since then.  All these years later, is there something that you still take away from your days in Miami?  The other one is, how are you different just from the last time that you were in the Finals, which was two years ago?\nLeBRON JAMES:   I think every part of anybody's individual life where they were able to grow, it never leaves you.  That's no different for me having my four years in Miami, being around -- with that culture, growing.  You guys don't realize, I talk about it, I went to Miami when I was 25 years old.  I was 25.  I was 25 to 29, so I was still growing.  I was still a kid and still trying to figure out who I am as a person and as a man, growing while still trying to compete for a championship every single year.\nI grew, and they allowed me to grow.  We pushed each other every single day, and like I said, I fit perfectly in that culture because I worked just as hard as anybody else.  I show up to work and I don't leave until I feel like I was as great as I was.  Do you always become successful at it?  Are you always going to win?  No, it doesn't happen like that.  But you're able to sleep a little bit better at night when you know you've punched the clock.\nAnd how am I different today than two years ago when I entered the Finals?  I've got a little bit more gray hair in my beard.\n",
  "Q. LeBron, we're just learning about your hand injury, and we can obviously see the brace.  Can you take us through what happened, and if it caused you any problems over the final three games?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: What happened?  Self-inflicted, postgame after Game 1.  Very emotional.  For a lot of different reasons, understanding how important a Game 1 is on the road for our ballclub, what would that have done for us, the way we played, the calls that were made throughout the course of that game.\r\nI had emotions on the game was taken away from us.  I had emotions of you just don't get an opportunity like this on the road versus Golden State to be able to get a Game 1, and I let the emotions get the best of me.  Pretty much played the last three games with a broken hand, so that's what it is.\nQ. I recognize The Finals just ended, but I know you're ready for these questions.  Do you feel like you've played your last game for the Cavs?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I mean, I have no idea at this point.  The one thing that I've always done is considered, obviously, my family.  Understanding especially where my boys are at this point in their age.  They were a lot younger the last time I made a decision like this four years ago.  I've got a teenage boy, a pre-teen and a little girl that wasn't around as well.\r\nSo sitting down and considering everything, my family is a huge part of whatever I'll decide to do in my career, and it will continue to be that.  So I don't have an answer for you right now as far as that.\nQ. How do you want this season to be remembered, given guys in their 15th year don't do this at all.  How do you want this year to be remembered?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: For me personally?\nQ. Yes.\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I have no idea.  That's for you guys to kind of figure out how you want to characterize my 15th season.  It's definitely been a whirlwind.  There's been ups and downs.  It's been good, it's been bad.\r\nFor me, I just try to be consistent throughout the course of the season.  Be the leader I know I can be for this ballclub, for this franchise every night, no matter what was going on from the outside or the inside, and be reliable every single day.  Showing up to work every single day.  Putting in the work and grinding every single day.\r\nI have no idea how the story will be talked about of my season, but, I know I punched the clock in every single day.  That's for me to understand that, and I'm okay with that.\nQ. You've gone through this dance that's coming this summer.  You've gone through this a few times.  Do you anticipate this just because of, like you said, the family and your kid's going into high school and your age and all those things, do you anticipate this summer being the toughest as far as deciding what the right path for you is?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: No, I feel like '10 was the toughest.\nQ. LeBron, how would you characterize these playoffs for you?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: For me personally?\nQ. And the team.\r\nLEBRON JAMES: And the team.  I wondered if we could hit a switch some way, somehow, just because the course of the regular season it was just like, I don't know.  You guys ask me a lot, our beat writers kind of ask us throughout the whole season, and then we made the trades.  And right before the playoffs, a couple weeks before the playoffs: Do you feel like your team is ready for the postseason.  I didn't know.  It was just the unknown.\r\nI mean, our season was kind of the unknown.  I wondered if we could hit a switch in the postseason.  I figured if I stayed laser sharp, if I came in with the right mentality, if I came in with the right mindset, that I could help fast-track this throughout a lot of the games in the postseason because of my experience and because of some of the other guys that experienced a lot of games.  I was able to do that.  We were able to do that.  I mean, I don't know.\r\nI think it's never a success in the postseason when you lose, not for me.  I have no idea.\r\nBut for me personally, like I said, being reliable to my teammates, being able to play the game at a high level with as many games and as many miles as I have on my body and put together a run like I had in the postseason, it's something that I can kind of remember.  The ending is obviously still fresh and still new, and you never want to lose, especially in this fashion, being a competitor.  But it is what it is.  Like I said, I punch my clock every day.\nQ. I know you have no way to know yet whether your time here is over or not, but I'm wondering what playing with the word Cleveland across your chest has meant to you for this second run?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I mean, at the end of the day, I came back because I felt like I had some unfinished business.  To be able to be a part of a championship team two years ago with the team that we had and in the fashion that we had is something I will always remember.  Honestly, I think we'll all remember that.  It ended a drought for Cleveland of 50-plus years, so I think we'll all remember that in sports history.\r\nWhen you have a goal, I think any individual, anybody, male, female, whatever the case may be, when you have a goal and you seek that goal out and you dream about that dream, and you put everything, and you care to -- you guys like this brace, huh (laughing)?  You guys like this cast, huh?  You want me to sit it right here for you (laughing)?\r\nI don't even know where I was.  I'm sorry.  Next question.  I'm sorry.\nQ. In 2010 you basically were part of a team starting from scratch in 2014, same process, and then four months ago you were able to get to The Finals.  If you had to do that again in your career, basically start a team from scratch, what have you learned from this year that you're a different team in February from what you're playing with in The Finals?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, it's definitely not the most comfortable thing to start a team from scratch, because the most important is health, because you need to build chemistry so fast and camaraderie so fast on the floor.  And if you have multiple injuries or you have multiple bodies out, when you're starting fresh, it's too hard.\r\nI think with this season, that's what you kind of saw.  The difference between this season and the difference between my first year in Miami, we didn't have many injuries at all.  And we were definitely fresh together.  But myself and D-Wade and Bosh, you know, UD (Udonis Haslem), Mike Miller had a few injuries, but (Mario) Chalmers was available, and pretty much our team, we were pretty solid as far as being injury -- not being injury-prone.\r\nObviously, my first year back here we were headed in the right direct, and then we hit the postseason.  Kev had a separated shoulder, and then Kyrie goes down in the first, second possession of overtime of Game 1 in The Finals.\r\nSo, I mean, that's just huge.  So being a part of the start-fresh mode is something that you definitely don't want to be a part of.  It has its pros and it definitely has its cons.\nQ. When you tell Rachel you came back because you had unfinished business, does one championship finish that business?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I mean, that's a trick question at the end of the day, and I'm not falling for that.\nQ. It's not a trick.\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Yes, it is.  I mean, for me, I still have so much to give to the game.  Like I said, when you have a goal and you're able to accomplish that goal, it actually -- for me personally, it made me even more hungry to continue to try to win championships, and I still want to be in championship mode.  I think I've shown this year why I will still continue to be in championship mode.\nQ. When you came back in '14 and we did the thing at InfoCision, understanding that things could change in four years, but you said you don't plan on going anywhere.  You can't go through this again.  What did you mean by that and what's this process like?  This free agency process of having to make a decision?  Can you just take us through and shed some light on what that process is like?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I mean, I'm not going to take you throughout the whole process.  That's not fun.  But at the end of the day, like I said, when I decide what I'm going to do with my future, my family and the folks that have been with me for the last, you know, 20 years, pretty much, will have a say-so.  Then it ultimately will come down to me, and so we'll see what happens.\nQ. When you made the move in 2010, obviously you had certain goals and things in mind that made you -- pushed you toward that decision, similar to 2014.  Are the decisions or the thought process, priorities, different at age 33, 15 years in than they would have been at those other junctures?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: No, I don't think so.  I made the move in 2010 to be able to play with talented players, cerebral players that you could see things that happen before they happened on the floor, and your teammate can do the same throughout the course of a season, throughout the course of a game, throughout the course of a playoffs, throughout the course of a Finals.\r\nSo when you feel like you're really good at your craft, I think it's always great to be able to be around other great minds as well and other great ballplayers, in my instance, and other great just, I think, studies of the game itself.\r\nThat's never changed.  Even when I came here in '14, I wanted to try to surround myself and surround this franchise with great minds and guys that actually think outside the box of the game and not just go out and play it.\nQ. LeBron, whatever you decide this summer, how likely is it that down the road you would want to actually own the Cavs and be the guy in charge here?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, that top athlete money-per-year thing came out last week and I was sixth, so I'm in no way, shape and form putting myself in a position right now to own a team.  I think Floyd (Mayweather) was 1 at like 252.  Obviously, I don't have a boxing hand.  So boxing won't be the sport I'll be going to.  I don't know.\r\nAt the end of the day, for me, staying around the game, being around the game will be something I'll probably do for the rest of my life, either while I'm playing for this later stage of my career, advising people in the NBA or whatever the case may be.  I've got two boys that play the game as well.  So I don't know.  I can't predict the future on ownership and things of that nature.\r\nBut I have a lot of knowledge of the game.  I understand talent.  I know talent.  I know the right questions to ask certain guys and see if they're smart enough to actually think the game as well.  So we'll see what happens.\n",
  "Q. How much has the load that you've had to carry offensively this season affected your ability to play defense at the level that you're capable of?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't think it's affected it.  The load that I have to carry offensively, it's been what the season has asked for.  Obviously, we haven't had many playmakers throughout the course of the season.  We had some early on, and we made the trades and things of that nature.\r\nBut it's been what the season has called for, and I've taken that responsibility to be able to have to make plays for myself and make plays for my teammates as well.\r\nDefensively, we've surrounded ourselves with some more wing defenders this year that allowed me to not have to exert so much energy defensively.  But whenever the number has been called for me to defend, I've been always taking that responsibility.  So I don't think that's changed.\nQ. There's always so much conversation about the Warriors offense, but what is it that makes their defense unique?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Draymond (Green).  Draymond is a catalyst and the anchor for their defense.  Very, very smart defensively.  He knows pretty much every set.  He kind of flies around and dictates their defense, either on the perimeter or protecting the rim as well.\nQ. You mentioned the trades.  When it happened, there wasn't much said by either of you.  Do you ever look back now and wish that you still had Dwyane Wade?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Oh, absolutely.  I mean, listen, not only from a brotherhood aspect and what we know about one another, and also from an experience factor.  I believe that he would have been very, very good for us in the postseason.  He's a guy that's kind of built for the postseason at this point in his career, who lives for the moment.\r\nSo definitely, definitely think about that.  It seems so long ago that he was even a part of this ballclub, but definitely think about it from time to time.\nQ. There is a maximum of four more games to the season for you guys.  I know you're a live-in-the-moment type of guy.  But when you look back at the 2017-18 season, what makes you feel good about the Cleveland Cavaliers and what you guys did?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: That's too hard for me to answer right now.  Like I said, I can answer that once this series is over.  Like I told you guys before, this has been one of the most challenging seasons of my career from the standpoint of what's been going on with our ballclub.  Not only from a playing perspective, but things -- guys changing, personnel changing, Coach being out for a couple weeks, players leaving and being out for a couple of weeks, injuries and things of that nature.\r\nI was having a great couple months, and then not playing so well, and then trades happened and things of that nature.  So I can go into more detail once this series is over.  But it's been three or four, maybe four or five seasons wrapped in one, that's for sure.\nQ. Completely different direction, but you said the other day when you were on FaceTime with Zhuri (James), your eye freaked her out.  Does it freak you out when you look in the mirror?  It's still as bright as the YouTube symbol.\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Yeah (laughing).  It's weird.  It's weird seeing it.  Hopefully, it will go away soon.  But it is what it is.  It's just part of a war wound.  And that's what happens when you're in the war sometimes; you get some injuries.  It hasn't stopped me from preparing, but it's different.\nQ. Golden State this year, this has been probably the hardest of the four years for them just because they were dealing with some doubt for the first time.  Steph Curry got hurt late.  Obviously, they got challenged big time in the West Finals.  As a fan of the game, as a student of the game, what have they shown you as far as their toughness and resiliency this year that wasn't really called on a whole lot in '15-' 17?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: At the end of the day, you can never count out a champion, no matter what's going on in the course of their season.  It's impossible to do that, because they're built from a different cloth, and I know that firsthand.\r\nWhen you win a championship and you're around guys for a long period of time, and you know what you're capable of doing, all you need is to get healthy.  If you can get healthy and guys are playing at the right level at the same time, then you can feel like you can beat anybody.\r\nSo the best thing about their team is that if one of their stars goes down, they have two or three other stars that are still able to hold the ship until everybody gets back.  Steph's injury, him going down, K.D. and Klay, who never misses a game, and Draymond still being in the lineup -- if you look at the previous time when K.D. went down, the rest of those guys were in and held it until K.D. came back for the playoffs the year before that.\r\nWhen you have the luxury of not being pressured to come back so fast -- and even with Iguodala, him not being pressured to feel like he needs to get back on the floor to help the team win, that the guys are going to continue to play well and whenever you're ready, we'll be ready for you to join.  I think it helps the injury as well, because you're not putting that much pressure on yourself.\r\nYou can never count out a champion at the end of the day, no matter how vulnerable people may seem or people think they may be, or if they hit some adversity.  I think it's all part of the process.\nQ. A non-Finals one.  It's not uncommon to see you courtside when Bronny is playing, of course.  What's that process been like for you watching him develop?  Obviously there's got to be some burdens on him being LeBron James Jr., of course.  But what's it been like for you watching him grow?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: It's been a treat to watch, being a parent and seeing my son grow as a basketball player.\r\nBut not only that, being a young man who he is today; the kid will be 14 soon.  Just seeing him grow and grow and grow to become who he is today has been a treat.\r\nI think from the burden of him having the name itself, I think him understanding that just go out and just play the game and have fun and play for your teammates and give it all you've got.  You play hard, you play smart and have fun, and let everything else take care of itself.\r\nThe one thing that I have is the luxury of knowing everything that he can expect.  There's nothing that can hit him that I haven't seen in my life.  There is no obstacle that he will run into that I haven't been a part of that I can't coach him.\r\nAt the end of the day, he's still going to have to live his own life and find his own path.  But I hope he turns off his comments on social media.  That would be the smartest thing he can do.\nQ. How does the outcome of these three games impact your love for competition and your mental approach to a challenge that has become even bigger now?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: No, listen, I love to compete.  At the end of the day, no matter win, lose or draw, being a part of the biggest stage in our sport is something that I've always loved and never taken for granted.\r\nMy love of the game continues to get bigger and bigger and greater and greater, and hopefully my game and my health continue to be at a level it is today for some years to come.\nQ. Kevin Love said after Game 1 that you've said to him this is the best you've ever felt.  You've obviously played in every game.  How much of a source of pride is that to you to have played this many games at this level?  Also, is this the best you've ever felt physically?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I think the simple fact to be available to my teammates every single night and knowing that I will be in uniform, that's the pride factor right there that I don't take for granted.\r\nAnd that's something I take a lot of pride in, just working my body every single day, no matter if it's a win, if it's a loss.  No matter if we're getting in at three o'clock in the morning, four o'clock in the morning, waking up the next day and doing something, either from a treatment side, lifting, conditioning, shooting or just preparing myself for the long journey.\r\nI just feel like I'm in a great groove right now as far as my career, as far as my body, knowing what I need to do to be in the best possible shape.  I said this at one point throughout this playoff run -- I had a walk-off with Cassidy Hubbarth after the game, and I told her it's the best I've felt in my career.\r\nShe kind of gave me one of those Cassidy looks, and I got some response from that.  But I was very truthful about it.\r\nI still feel good, even with turning my ankle last night or getting a finger jammed into my eye and taking the bumps and bruises and grinds throughout this playoff series.  I still feel like I'm excited to put on the uniform tomorrow.  So, yeah.\nQ. As a quick follow-up on the ankle.  The TV cameras kind of caught you like turning it or putting it back into place.  Did you fix your ankle on the court?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't (laughing) -- I'm a little weird.  That's all.  Just a little weird.\nQ. You mentioned getting ready for Game 4 tomorrow.  A difficult finish last night.  But what did you see when you reviewed the game this morning that you can take as a positive heading into Game 4 for your performance in Game 3?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: From a team aspect?  We just had great moments.  We had great moments.  It's hard for me.  I'm not a guy that takes positives from games.  If you lose, it's negative to me.  It's just how I am.  You can take little bits and pieces and say, OK, well, we played great for the first 24 minutes, but then we didn't play well for that 12 minutes in the third quarter.  We should know that Golden State is the best third quarter team in the NBA, and they try to put you away in that third quarter.\r\nThe fourth quarter, we had opportunities.  They scored, we came right back.  They hit momentum plays -- they went up 4, we came down and hit a 3.  Made it a one-possession game.\r\nYou've just got to try to hunker down and get stops and try to create a little space.  But we weren't able to do that.  So there were some positives, but there were a lot of negatives as well.\r\nIn the third quarter, they had six or seven dunks or uncontested layups.  I mean, you can't have that.  You've already got to worry about the three-headed monster shooting from 35 feet in Klay, Steph and K.D.  And then you're giving up layups and dunks to McGee and Draymond and Iguodala and Livingston.  You just can't have that.\nQ. You first faced Kevin Durant on this stage back in 2012.  I think he was 23 at the time.  You guys beat him 4-1.  Did you leave that series at all thinking like that guy's going to be a roadblock down the line, really on this stage a lot?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Yeah.  I thought it would be in OKC.  I thought we'd have to face them for a while.  Yeah, absolutely.  Who wouldn't see that?\nQ. Do you remember anything specifically in that series that he showed you?  Obviously, he was already a good player to that point.\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I mean, in that series, I don't know.  I mean, it's Kevin Durant at 23.  It's Kevin Durant at 18, it's Kevin Durant at 20, 21, 22.  There's nothing that Kevin Durant could show me at 23 that would make me like, Oh, years from now -- no, Kevin Durant was great at 23.  As you get older and older, your game gets more and more seasoned.  But everyone knew that.  That's Kevin Durant.\r\nSo it's not like you would think that he would fizzle out.  You knew he was built for greatness from the time that he was drafted.  I mean, everybody knew that besides Portland, I guess.  Sorry, Portland.  Sorry.\nQ. I guess in your career, this started with the Celtics getting Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen, then you go to Miami with D-Wade and Chris Bosh to try to take those guys out.  You come back here with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, and the next thing you know the Warriors have Kevin Durant.  How do you view that dynamic where players, superstars in this league are able to kind of control their own destiny to some degree?  Or is there a level of disappointment having now been maybe on the other side of that a little bit that you put in all this work to put a team together and build it a certain way and put in all the work, and someone just comes along and puts something else together that might be better?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Yeah, that's the challenge in this league.  I think every GM and every president and every coaching staff is trying to figure out how they can make up the right matchups to compete for a championship and win a championship.\r\nLike you said before, I felt like my first stint here I just didn't have the level of talent to compete versus the best teams in the NBA, let alone just Boston.  When you looked at (Rajon) Rondo and KG and Paul (Pierce) and Ray, you knew they were great basketball players.  But not only great basketball players, you could see their minds were in it, too, when you were playing them.  They were calling out sets.  Rondo was calling out sets every time you come down.  It was like, OK, this is bigger than basketball.\r\nSo not only do you have to have the talent, you have to have the minds as well.  I knew that my talent level here in Cleveland couldn't succeed getting past a Boston, getting past the San Antonios of the league or whatever the case may be.\r\nI played with D-Wade, I played with Bosh in the Olympics.  I knew D-Wade for years.  I knew their minds.  I knew how they thought the game, more than just playing the game.  Obviously, we all knew their talent, but I knew their minds as well.  So I linked up with them.  We went to Miami.  Got some other great minds in Mike Miller; UD (Udonis Haslem) is a great mind but also a competitor.  And guys that were talents.  You build that talent.  That's what you want to try to do.\r\nThen you come here.  I knew Kyrie, having the talent, I wanted to try to build his mind up to fast track his mind because I felt like in order to win you've got to have talent, but you've got to be very cerebral too.\r\nListen, we're all NBA players.  Everybody knows how to put the ball in the hoop.  But who can think throughout the course of the game?\r\nThis is so challenging for me to sit up here and say because people who really don't know the game don't really know what I'm talking about.  They just think that you go out, and, Oh, LeBron, you're bigger and faster and stronger than everybody, you should drive every single time and you should dunk every single play and you should never get tired, never.  Like it's a video game and you went on the options and you turned down fatigue all the way to zero and injuries all the way down to zero (laughing).\r\nSo we come back here and we get the minds and we build a championship team.  And then Golden State, because of Steph's injuries early on in his career and his contract situation, and then them drafting Draymond and drafting Klay and them being under the contracts they were in, allowed their franchise to go out to get K.D.\r\nSo they win a championship.  Then we play them and we come back from 3-1 and we beat them.  But that was the best regular season -- probably the best team I had ever played against.  They go 73-9, and then you add one of the best players that the NBA has ever seen.\r\nSo now everyone is trying to figure that out.  How do you put together a group of talent but also a group of minds to be able to compete with Golden State, to be able to compete for a championship?  That's what GMs and presidents and certain players -- it's not every player.  Every player does not want to -- sad to say, but every player doesn't want to compete for a championship and be in a position where every possession is pressure.\r\nYou had a follow up, it looks like (laughing).\nQ. You mentioned in the first part of your answer, when you were here the first time, you came to the conclusion you didn't have enough.  I'm not trying to get you to say anything negative about anybody.  But how do you feel now?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: You actually are trying to get me to say something (laughing).\nQ. I don't know what your answer is.\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Listen, at the end of the day, I'm living in the moment now.  I went back for you for your question.  We've had an opportunity to win two of these games in this three-game series so far, and we haven't come up with it.  Obviously, from a talent perspective, if you're looking at Golden State from their top five best players to our top five players, you would say they're stacked better than us.\r\nLet's just speak truth.  Kevin Durant.  You've got two guys with MVPs on their team.  And then you've got a guy in Klay who could easily be on a team and carry a team, score 40 in a quarter before.  And then you have Draymond, who is arguably one of the best defenders and minds we have in our game.  So you have that crew.\r\nThen you add on a Finals MVP coming off the bench, a number one pick in Livingston and an All-Star in David West and whatever the case may be.  So they have a lot of talent.\r\nWe have a lot of talent as well.  We've been in a position where we could win two out of these three games.  So what do we have to do?  Do we have to make more shots?  Is it we have to have our minds into it a little bit more?  Is it if there is a ball on the ground we can't reach for it but you've got to dive for it?\r\nWhen you're playing, like I stated last night, or like 12 hours ago -- was it 12 hours ago? -- the room for error versus a team like this is slim to none.  And I think I said last night it's like playing the Patriots.  It's like playing San Antonio.  The room for error is slim to none.  When you make mistakes they make you pay, because they're already more talented than you are but they also have the minds behind it, too, and they also have the championship DNA.\n",
  "Q. The core of this Cavs team has remained consistent for the last few years, but you've got a lot of new teammates on this team from a few months ago.  Are you confident that your teammates can mentally reset after this tough loss and be where they need to be for Game 4?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I mean, it's definitely a tough loss, and we had our chances.  But we have another opportunity on Friday to win on our home floor.  We've been pretty good throughout the postseason.\r\nSo that's a good thing for us that we have an opportunity to extend the series, but we've got to come out and play 48 minutes.  We know this team that we're going against are the best -- first of all, the best third quarter team in the NBA, and once again they showed that tonight by outscoring us by 8 after we had a lead at halftime.\r\nSo we have to be dialed in and play like we did in the first half and in the fourth quarter tonight.\nQ. You twisted your ankle pretty badly there in the first half.  How is that feeling?  And Kevin Love was just in here and he talked about the margin of error being so small with the Warriors, especially in Game 1 and Game 3.  But how does that give you guys confidence going forward knowing how close you actually were to win those games?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: To answer your second question first, the margin of error is very low.  You can't -- I mean, it's almost like playing the Patriots, you can't have mistakes.  They're not going to beat themselves.  You know, so when you're able to either force a miscue on them, you have to be able to capitalize and you have to be so in tuned and razor sharp and focused every single possession.  You can't have miscommunication, you can't have flaws, you can't have \"my faults\" or \"my bads\" or things like that, because they're going to make you pay.  When they make you pay, it's a 3-0 or 6-0 or 9-0 run, and it comes in bunches.\r\nThe room for error, you just can't have it.  We know throughout the course of a 48-minute game there are going to be plays where, you know, it was a miscue there, it was a miscue there.  But for the most part throughout 48 minutes you just can't have a bunch of those, not especially against this team.\r\nTo answer your first question, yeah, I twisted it pretty good, but I'll be in the lineup on Friday.\nQ. Two questions and both are bigger picture.  Now that you've been in this series with Durant and the Warriors now twice, can you articulate just how Durant has changed the complexion of this series and rivalry?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Oh, well, I mean, you guys ask me what is the difference between the Warriors -- you guys asked me this last year, what was the difference between the Warriors the previous year and this year, and what was my answer?  All right.  There it is.  Kevin Durant was my answer.\r\nHe's one of the best players that I've ever played against that this league has ever seen.  His ability to handle the ball, shoot the ball, make plays at his length, his size, his speed.  So there it is.\nQ. The other one, I understand you guys are down 3-0, but you've been very close twice, and they almost lost in the Western Finals.  So the question is are they at all maybe more vulnerable than you thought they were earlier in the year, mid-year, something like that?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: At the end of the day, if you want to compete for a championship or win a championship, you've got to go through the champion, and they're the champion.  No matter -- everyone gets so caught up on saying they're vulnerable or they're not playing so well, and then they go down 3-2, and then they go to somebody else's floor and win.  Or they win at home and send it back to somebody else's floor and win in a Game 7.\r\nThat's what championship teams do.  That's what championship players do.  They rise to the occasion, and that's what Golden State has done the last four years.\nQ. Even for someone like you who notoriously can have singular focus on one thing more often than not, how difficult will the next 48 hours be to just lock in on Game 4 and not think about how 1 and 3 got away or what might happen this summer?  How tough would it be for you to stay in this moment?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Tim, for me, tonight will be tough.  Tomorrow I'll replay some plays and some moments and things of that nature.  When I wake up Friday morning I'll be locked in on the game plan of what needs to be done to help our team win.  That's just who I am.\r\nSo the rest of the night will be tough.  I'm not sure what time I'll end up getting to bed.  Tomorrow we'll come in and watch film, so it will replay in my mind throughout the day.  But Friday morning when I wake up, I'll be locked in and ready for Game 4.\nQ. Do you just tip your hat when K.D. makes the same shot from the left wing he made in Game 3 last year?  And how difficult is the shot?  He may make it look pretty attainable, but how difficult a shot is that?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: No, that wasn't the same shot.  The one he made tonight was about four or five feet behind the one he made last year.  Last year we were up 2, and he pulled up pretty much right at the three-point line and got a great contest, but he made it.\r\nTonight they're up 3.  They come off a pick-and-roll and he just stopped behind and pulled four or five feet behind the three-point line.  So same wing, different location.\r\nBut you definitely tip your hat.  I mean, that's what he does.  He's a scorer.  You know, he's assassin, and that was one of those assassin plays right there.\nQ. Last game Steph goes off, an NBA Finals record, nine threes.  This time you hold him to 1 of 10 and another guy goes off.  Defensively what can you do to stop enough of them to a degree that you can have more points than they at the end of the game?  Also, could you speak to Rodney Hood's contributions tonight?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: That's the challenge right there.  That's the challenge.  You know, that's why they've retooled this team, went out and got K.D. to where there's really not much pressure on -- you know, I won't say any of them to score, but if one of them has a bad game, they have three or four guys that can actually pick up the load.\r\nAnd as you've seen with K.D. picking it up today and Steph picking it up in Game 2, they all have the ability to -- we can't ever forget about Klay.  He's a guy that scored 40 in a quarter before.  So that's the luxury of having guys like that that you can always -- any given moment, they can kind of go off for a game.\r\nEven though we held Steph to one three tonight, the one he made was huge, huge.  So we've got to continue to just grind and defend as we did tonight.  I mean, out of the nine threes made, K.D. had six of them.  They were 9 for 36.  And that's, you know, pretty daggone good, holding that team to shooting to the free-throw line.  But we've got to add a little bit more, keep grinding.\r\nTo your second question, I thought Rodney Hood was Rodney Hood tonight.  That was Rodney Hood, man.  He was just aggressive from the beginning when he got in the game, even though he missed his first three.  He had a wide-open shot, but he just continued to push and push.\r\nHis athleticism and his length and his touch around the rim, you know, it was more than just what he did for the team, I think for himself, that was just a huge moment for himself.  That was good to see.  That was great to see, actually.\nQ. Knowing that you had that tremendous recall of moments in games, can you describe what was in your mind both tonight and last year when Kevin Durant launched that shot from the wing?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I actually think you should be like a psychiatrist.  You want to keep trying to get inside somebody's mind, is the whole thing, Mark.\r\nWhat's in my mind?  Miss it so we can get the rebound.\nQ. Did it feel like last year to you?  Did you think of it at that moment?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: No.\nQ. Going back to the margin for error thing, when you're playing against a team like the Warriors, how much stress do you feel throughout the course of the game?  Is that something that can wear on you mentally in a way that it doesn't for other opponents?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Say that again, please?\nQ. The margin for error, knowing that it's small going into a game.  Can you talk about the level of stress that you feel throughout the course of a game knowing that, and does it wear on you mentally in a way that it wouldn't with other opponents?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I can take you back kind of to the battles I had with the Spurs when I was in Miami.  You just knew that they wouldn't beat themselves.  You just knew that like every possession we were playing San Antonio when I was in Miami, you just knew if you made a mistake, Manu, Tim, Tony, Pop will make you pay.  At times they did make us pay, and then you sprinkle in what Gary Neal did to us one game, what Danny Green did to us one game.  Then Kawhi, you just couldn't -- you could never relax.\r\nWhen you have great basketball players but also that can also think the game and be very cerebral about the game, that's what adds the level of stress, because you know that you can never, ever relax.\r\nAnd you should never want to relax.  It's The Finals.  It's the playoffs.  Even though this is a regular season game, you should always want to be on your toes.  That's what the part of competition is about.  So it adds to the level of stress.\r\nWhen you have Timmy D. and Manu and Kawhi and Manu, and now Draymond and Klay, Steph and K.D., and then you sprinkle in Iguodala and Livingston and all those guys as well, it adds a level of stress.  Because you know that you can never relax.  You know if you relax, they make you pay, and making you pay could cost you a game.\r\nSo it's tough, but it's all part of the competition, which I love and which I continue to lace them up every night.\r\nHopefully I got your answer for you.  Appreciate it.\n",
  "Q. You always talk about experience be the greatest teacher.  What do you hope your team has learned during this crazy season that can carry you guys forward now?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I think just being persistent.  We've been very persistent and very resilient throughout this whole season, no matter what has been going on.  We have an opportunity to come home and protect home, as Golden State has done.\r\nWe look forward to the challenge.  It's a very tall task.  A very tough challenge, as I mentioned before the series even started, going against these guys, going against this team.  But we have an opportunity to seize the opportunity.  So I look forward to that.\nQ. In training camp, you talked about this in regard to the Warriors.  But do you have any comment on Trump uninviting the Eagles to the White House after most of the black players decided not to go?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I actually just found out about it as I was walking up to the podium.  I didn't really digest it enough.  But it's typical of him.  I'm not surprised.  It's typical of him.  I don't know.  I mean, I know no matter who wins this series, no one wants the invite anyway.  So it won't be Golden State or Cleveland going.\nQ. Any thoughts on the stand the black players made?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I mean, listen, we have a lot of freedom in our country.  Guys -- men or female -- have the right to do what they want to do in a very respectful manner.  I think if they decided they don't want to go, then they have the right.\nQ. To follow up on that, the Pats sent half their team.  Then Steph came out and said he didn't have any interest in going.  Then you supported Steph on Twitter, I remember.  Does it surprise you that the divide just seems to be growing right now after even more than a year of this discourse?  It seems that the gap is widening instead of any bridge being found.\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I think as long as he's in office, then the communication and things like that are going to continue to happen.  It's a lot of things that we believe in as Americans that we don't feel that he's for.  There are a lot of people that believe that he's not for the people or doing things that's right by the people.\r\nSo it's not surprising hearing the news today with the Eagles.  But I think more importantly, as Americans and especially people in Philadelphia, we shouldn't let that news take away from what that unbelievable team did and accomplished, what all those players did to sacrifice throughout each and every Sunday, going out and playing the style of football that they played and winning a Super Bowl the way they won it.  Let's not let that accomplishment of things that you will have for the rest of your life, and people will always call you a champion for the rest of your life, let's not let someone uninviting you to their house take away from that moment.  Because I think the championship -- winning a Super Bowl or winning a Stanley Cup or winning a World Series or winning an NBA Championship or National Championship -- is way bigger than getting invited to the White House, especially with him in there, in my opinion.\nQ. Just one more layer on that.  LeBron, the Minnesota Lynx won the WNBA title this year, a great series, great final game.  They didn't even get an invite.  You've always been really supportive of the WNBA and women's basketball.  What did you think of that?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I think it's laughable at this point.  You always hear the saying: You just laugh to stop you from crying.  I think that's a lot of the instances that are going on as far as outside of the sports world.  But we know how important sports is to our country and how it continues to bring people together, excite people, make people talk about it, no matter if it's here on this stage here or on the streets or on the bus, in the barbershops, in coffee shops or wherever the case may be.  We know sports is so big because it's able to captivate people and bring people together.\r\nFor them not to even be invited, playing our beautiful game of basketball -- no matter if it's the WNBA or NBA or little leagues or high school, whatever the case may be, it's basketball.  It's our beautiful game.  Those women, those girls, they're unbelievable at doing it.  I think it's laughable, in my opinion.\nQ. You're shooting nearly 50% from the mid range in this postseason.  How confident are you in that shot compared to earlier points in your career?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I'm confident in every part of my game at this point in my career.  I don't believe there are any dare shots that you can dare me to take and I'm not confident with making them.\nQ. Ty Lue told us he wants you guys to be more physical against the Warriors tomorrow and Friday.  How difficult will that be to do that and just stay within your normal game?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, bringing a physicality to a game, I think, has always been a point of emphasis for our ballclub.  I think it started from Game 1 of the Indiana series.  They were more physical than us, and we realized that the playoffs had started.  The guys that hadn't been a part of the postseason realized that the playoffs were here.  From that point on, physicality has been a point of emphasis.  So I don't think that should change no matter who your opponent is.\nQ. Everyone talks about home-court advantage, and you guys have clearly had it through these playoffs.  Can you be specific about what it is that makes you play so well in this building?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, first of all, you give a lot of credit to the fans.  The fans bring you so much excitement as well.  I always believe like the role players play much better at home than they do on the road.  They feed off the crowd.  They feed off the familiarity with not only being home but being on their home floor, having their own locker and things of that nature.\r\nSo I think that's definitely helped us out a lot throughout this postseason thus far.  Pretty much in the postseason since I returned a few years ago.\nQ. There is a clip that's gone viral of that Game 1 timeout huddle before going into overtime.  It seemed like you were just finding out that you guys still had a timeout.  What was going through your head at that time?  Was it pretty self-explanatory?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Pretty much.  It went viral?\nQ. Pretty much?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Damn cameras (laughing).  I haven't seen it.  I'm not on social media right now.\nQ. Could you elaborate a little bit more?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: You're taking me back to Game 1?\nQ. I'm sorry.\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I finally got Game 1 out of my head.  You're taking me back, huh?  OK.  OK.  Let me put myself back there.\r\nSo if I remember, yeah, I was sitting on the bench and kind of just contemplating the last couple seconds of what just happened, what expired, from J.R. [Smith] dribbling the ball out to G-Hill [George Hill] missing the free throw, actually seeing Draymond [Green] step in early on the lane violation.  Asking myself did I have a lane to actually drive it if I didn't.  So there were a lot of things playing through my head.\r\nWhen the game clock went off before J.R. kind of threw the ball to G-Hill to the corner, I actually tried to call timeout.  I believe it was Ed Malloy that was right there, our referee.  I don't know if I had enough time because I was kind of a little bit still in shock of what was going on at that point in time.\r\nI got to the bench, first thing that came to my mind I was like, OK, I was calling a timeout.  But hopefully, I'm glad maybe if we didn't have any, I'm glad they didn't give it to me.  I didn't want another C-Webb [Chris Webber] incident.  If that happened, then they go to make their free throws and the game is over.\r\nSo I asked our coaching staff if we had a timeout.  And they told me, yes.  I guess y'all probably seen the reaction from that point on.\nQ. So that was more so the reaction from not getting the timeout after you were signaling for it?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Yeah, it was just knowing that we had an opportunity to have another possession, even with the offensive rebound.  It was just -- it was just a heartbreaking loss.\nQ. You're down 2-0 to Golden State again.  Does this 2-0 feel differently than the previous two seasons?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I mean, I have no idea.  I don't know how I felt last year or the year before that.  I'm not quite sure.  I know it feels like we're down 2-0, and I don't like the way I feel.  I don't like the way -- the mood that I'm in right now, knowing whatever.  There's no, like, OK, you're down 2-0 and you feel better than when you're down 2-0 before.\r\nI mean, when you're down like this, in a deficit like this versus a team like this, there's no good feeling.  So I don't feel good about it.\nQ. With that moment between regulation and overtime, like Chris said, it has gone viral --\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Give me one second, sorry.  [Addressing previous question again] I don't feel good how I feel right now, not how I feel about the rest of the series.  I know how clips can get broken up and somebody can clip that and be like, Oh, LeBron said he doesn't feel good.  I personally don't feel good today of the deficit that we have.  Not about tomorrow.  I feel great about our opportunity.  Go ahead.\nQ. During those moments between regulation and overtime in Game 1, like Chris said, it has gone viral, meaning you have been getting criticized for not trying to pick up your teammates during that time.  Is that fair criticism, not being in your shoes?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Me?  Me being criticized?  No.  You're saying I got criticized for something, right?  I don't believe that.  Not me (Smiling).  I don't care.  I don't care at all.\r\nI mean, we're in the NBA Finals.  I mean, how much more picking up of teammates do you want me to do?  I'm in the NBA Finals, looking for a championship.  All right, appreciate it.\n",
  "Q. LeBron, you always talk about you've seen every defense that anybody can throw at you.  Did it seem that Golden State came out tonight looking to try to attack you a little bit more earlier in the shot clock and maybe tried to limit you as much to not drive as much?  You ended up with 13 assists, but it seemed like they really made you work hard tonight for everything you got.\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I think I only got tired once tonight.  So, I mean, they doubled me a few times when I caught the ball in the post, something they didn't do in Game 1.  So I got off the ball, trusted my teammates.  But as far as working harder, I think I got tired once.\nQ. Steph set an NBA Finals record tonight with nine three-point shots, but some of them were much more difficult than others.  He had the 23 1/2 seconds of great defense, and goes out 25 feet, turns around and hits one.  How deflating is it when he's got it going and makes shots that almost he has no business making or taking?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Every shot that he takes that goes in, he has the business of making them.  That's what he does.  So shouldn't be surprised or deflated at it.  Take the ball out, move it forward, and try to execute on the other end.\nQ. Obviously Steph, Klay, K.D. had great games, as expected.  But how dangerous are the Warriors when you have McGee and also Livingston perfect from the field?  I think it was 11 field goals total, 11 for 11.\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I mean, they're a dangerous ballclub no matter what.  It starts with those four guys, obviously, the four All-Stars.  Everyone else just does their job, and they don't miss a beat when they put someone in or they take someone out.  You know, it's not something that's surprising.\nQ. If you had to point to one or two things that you could take with you as a group going back to Cleveland for Game 3 that makes you feel good about where you could be in this series, what would it be?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I think at the end of the day we have a Game 3 to play.  You know, we've got an opportunity to go home, and we played some really good basketball on our home floor.  But that shouldn't give us any comfort.  We should still be uncomfortable with the series as we were in Game 1 and as we were tonight.\nQ. When you're facing -- a lot of people feel like the odds are against you in this series.  Do you feel like there is too much pressure put on you to be able to try to do too much for your team?  Is it fair?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: No, I don't really get caught up in that.  I mean, the odds have been against me since -- I don't know, since I was five, six years old.  So we're talking about basketball here.  It seems like I come up here and tell you guys this all the time.  The odds have been stacked up against me since I was an adolescent.\r\nSo I put our team in position to try to win a championship, to compete for a championship.  You know, it's my job to make sure that we're as focused, laser focused as possible, do my job, and continue to instill confidence into my teammates until the last horn sounds.\r\nThat's my job.  That's my responsibility.  That's my obligation, and I need to continue to do that, which I will.\nQ. You're one of those guys who has said a lot of times -- like you, Dwyane, a lot of guys over the years have said that a series doesn't truly start until one team wins on the other's home floor.  How much are you going to remind your guys that over the next three days?  Just, I mean, as hard as it might be to sell them on, to remind them that Golden State just held serve?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: They did that.  But like I said, we want to continue to be uncomfortable.  Just because we're going home doesn't mean we can relax.  This is the last team in the world you want to relax against.  They've proven they can win on someone else's floor, no matter if it's through adversity as people may call it like when they were going through the Rockets series or whatever the case may be.  They've proven they can win on someone else's floor and do it in any fashion, in any way.\r\nI will continue to stay uncomfortable, and I hope our guys continue to stay uncomfortable no matter with us going back home.\nQ. You've been in this situation three years in a row now 0-2.  Can you draw back on some of those experiences in terms of your strategy going forward?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: No.\nQ. You've always been a guy that played the game with a lot of love, with a lot of joy for the game.  In the moment that you're in right now, with the challenge being as great as it is and the burden on you as great as it is, does it make it harder to find those moments of enjoyment and kind of enjoying the competition as opposed to just continuing to just push and grind through?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Absolutely not.  I mean, it sucks to lose.  It sucks when you go out there and you give it everything that you have and you prep and your mind is in it and your body is in it and you come out on the losing end.  But nothing would ever take the love of the game away from me.  I think the love of the competition is something I live for and something I wake up every day and train my body for and train my mind for.\r\nYeah, I mean, it sucks to lose, that's for sure, but it definitely won't stop me from preparing to be better the next day.\nQ. You spoke with us yesterday about getting the treatment for your eye.  Still looking a little bloody there.  How was it tonight, and going forward do you think it's something that you just have to learn to work around?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Yeah, I mean, I'm going to have to work around it until it's not bloody anymore.  I mean, it's not going to keep me out of a game.  I'll be active -- what's today?  What is today?  Sunday?  When do we play again?  Wednesday?  So I'll be active.  I'll be in uniform, and I'll continue to try to make plays and help our team be successful and try to get one up on the board.\r\nThe eye has looked a lot better.  My daughter don't like the way I look right now (laughing).  Yeah, she didn't like the FaceTime that we had earlier.  She was a little weirded out about it.  But I'll be fine.  So everything's good.  Appreciate it.\n",
  "Q. There is a talking point since Game 1 that you guys are going to be deflated after such a frustrating loss.  I'm just wondering what your response to that is?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't really have a response to it.\nQ. How do you expect your team to come out tomorrow?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I expect us to come and play with the same grit that we had in Game 1.  And we made a lot of mistakes in Game 1.  I expect us to be better.\nQ. You've been through adversity your entire life, on the court, off the court.  What have you learned since you were a young player or even a young person about how to overcome adversity that can help you in this particular situation after such a difficult Game 1 loss?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I mean, it's a new day.  For me, I woke up feeling excited about the opportunity for us to get better today.  Excited about the opportunity that presents itself tomorrow.\r\nI can never compare the adversity I went through when I was younger compared to playing basketball.  This is just basketball.  This is not adversity.  Not with the things I've been through in my life.  This is fun.\nQ. Secondly, George Hill said yesterday that for him Game 1 was the toughest loss in his entire career.  How can you as a leader help lift a player like that who maybe hasn't been through it before?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: We both went through some of the same emotions.  It's one of the toughest losses I've had in my career as well because of everything that kind of went on with the game and the way we played.  Obviously, we all know what happened in the game.\r\nSo it was a tough 24 hours not only for G-Hill and for myself but for our whole ballclub, because we put ourselves in a great position to be successful.\r\nBut like I said, you give yourself a day -- if you need to take two days, OK.  But today you should feel excited about the opportunity to be better and be great and move forward.\nQ. I know you talked a lot about how important sleep is for your recovery and how vital it is for your performance.  I remember back in Miami Dwyane Wade was always team no sleep.  But I was curious when you believed that sleep was this weapon for you and how that evolved throughout your career, whether you were prioritizing it when you were a rookie and when did that really impact you?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I think as you get older, you understand what benefits your body more and more, depending on what you put in your body as far as food and nutrition, things like that, how many hours a night that you try to get.  Obviously, some nights are different from others, but how much optimal sleep you want to get to help your body recover.  How much working out and things that you do.\r\nI think every individual is different.  I found a great balance in what helps me be in the best possible shape I can be on a day-to-day basis.  I just try to follow that.\nQ. Early in your career did you have the same appreciation for it, or did you just learn over time?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: No.  I mean, I was 18 when I came into the league.  I could do whatever I wanted to do.  I could stay up throughout the whole night and play 48 minutes the next night and then not ice after the game and go right home.  I was 18.  I didn't even tape my rookie year.  No, I'm totally different.\nQ. Years ago there was a concept known as the Jordan Rules.  Just certain principles that certain teams believed they had to live by in order to defend him.  Given all the approaches that you've seen throughout your career, all the coverages, all the different looks that you get from game to game in a series like this and even within a game, how would you define the LeBron rules?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't think there are LeBron Rules.  I think for me personally, I think a coaching staff puts together a game plan that best suits his team, best suits the individual when going against myself and my teammates, and they try to be successful with that.\r\nObviously we've all heard of the, quote/unquote, Jordan Rules or whatever the case may be and whoever decided to bring that notion up and a way to stop Jordan.  But I think more importantly this is a team game, and coaching staffs put together game plans that best fit their team to stop either that dynamic player but also the rest of the guys on the floor as well.\nQ. What would you say is the biggest difference in how you're defended now versus when you -- early in your career when you first came into the league?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: There were parts of my game that you could disrespect early in my career.  You can't do that now.\nQ. We can't see it under your hat, so how's your eye today?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: It's better.  It doesn't look better, but the docs told me it's better.  It's just going through a stage right now of recovering.  It looks worse than it did during the game, but it feels better.\nQ. Did you basically score 51 points with one eye that was blurry?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: No, I had some points before that already (laughing).\nQ. Can you see now?  Is it still blurry?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I'm taking my medication that I've been given by the doctors.  My eye drops and my antibiotic to help me with the recovery as fast as possible.  But it's an eye.  I mean, it's going to recover as fast as it can on its own.  There is nothing you can do.  I can't ice it or anything like that, or if I get more sleep or whatever the case may be.  I'll just have to naturally, organically let heal.\r\nLike I said, it's been better.  But it's better today than it was in Game 1.  Like I said, it doesn't look better, but it feels a lot better.\nQ. As Game 1 was starting, Dan Gilbert sent out a number of tweets basically with his thoughts on how this team made it to The Finals this year.  Were you aware of those tweets, and did you have any reaction to them after the game?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: No, not aware.  I'm not on social media right now, so I wasn't aware of that.  It was his account though, right.\r\n(Laughter)\nQ. One of the many things that you're obviously notorious for is getting to know the strengths and weaknesses of your teammates, from how they like the ball passed to them to the spin, to the speed.  You've kind of taken that to the next level.  Your time with J.R. Smith, what have you learned about him as far as what you needed to do with him the last 24 to 48 hours to get his mind right for tomorrow night?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I think J.R. is one of the most resilient guys I've ever been around.  I think it just comes from not only him personally but his household -- his mom, his dad, his brothers and sisters.  And his family now as well.\r\nHe probably took that loss as hard as anybody on the team.  But one thing about J.R., he has an uncanny ability to bounce back.  I think people have seen that throughout our postseason runs, where he hasn't played well or played to his ability that he thinks he should have played, and then the next game he comes on and shoots the ball extremely well.  It's just very locked in.\r\nFor me, I don't think I need to say anything to J.R.  I've known J.R. since he was in high school.  It's not like he's a new teammate of mine or someone I just met.  J.R. knows what I expect out of him.  He expects things out of me.  And we just try to go get it done.\nQ. Along the line of questioning regarding the LeBron Rules, when you're getting different defensive coverages and switches from different personnel, what sort of things are you reading and trying to take advantage of?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I think it's all about angles.  For me, seeing things before they happen, being able to beat a defender that's in front of me, but understanding there's going to be multiple guys either stabbing at the ball, rotating, poking at the ball, putting bodies and hands in front of me.  So you have to be strong with the ball, first of all.  Especially against the Golden State Warriors team that is so great with their hands, either from Steph, Draymond, obviously.  Iggy didn't play in Game 1, but in the past we know Iggy -- Shaun Livingston, and the rest go on.  They're so good with their hands that you have to be very strong with the ball.  So being able to read and react to the defense, being able to not only get past your guy but know when the rotations happen and being able to put the ball on time and on target to your teammates.\r\nThere are a lot of things that go on.  I just try to read and react and know what's going on throughout the course of a game.  It may change from quarter to quarter.  Coaches make adjustments.  Players make adjustments on how to guard you.  And then you always have to be on your toes on seeing that throughout the course of a 48-minute game.\nQ. How are they different defensively without Andre so far?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, they're damn good with him and they're damn good without him.  No matter offensively or defensively.  Listen they've had a two-time MVP sit out playoff games and they've won, all right.  They're good.  They're great, actually.  So let's not get too far on that.\nQ. When you first came in the league, the only time you would hear criticism would be from I guess us, media members.  Now with social media and people come up with these memes and these creative bits and whatnot, how have you adjusted to that?  I don't know if you engage or look into that.  Secondly, how have you noticed your teammates or your peers, is it a negative effect on them if they consume that too much?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I think it comes with growth.  I think it comes with understanding what matters and what doesn't matter in your life, in your personal life.\r\nFor me, it took time.  I mean, obviously I came into the NBA before social media.  I don't know how many people were part of the league before social media that's in here.  But I see a few of you.  Got some gray-haired guys in here.  So you guys were definitely around then.\r\nYou could hear criticism, but it took four or five people to finally get to you if the criticism happened.  Then as you get into the later years of the 2000s, the social media thing.  Everybody is excited about it.  Everybody is like, OK, just the touch of a finger you can pull something or see something.  Everybody's like, it's the greatest thing ever.\r\nThen if you're a celebrity, you realize it's actually really bad for you if you pay attention to it.  Like, if you really pay attention, there are people out there that really try to tear you down.  You have to realize that, one, you don't know who they are.  Two, they don't know what they're talking about.  Three, they've never stepped in your shoes or been in the light to understand what it means to have to perform or whatever the case may be.\r\nI guarantee that there are doctors and surgeons and cops and firefighters and people like that on social media and people are roasting them too.  As you get older, you realize I'm going to do what I do.  I put all my time into my craft.  I gave it all that I have, and I live with the results.\r\nYou can't get involved in that.  I can only speak for me.  I've learned how to laugh at the memes that come through.  I've learned if it's someone that's trying to kill me in the fashion to laugh at that, too, because it's funny at times as well, and not take too much into it.\r\nI can't sit here and tell you how my teammates go about it, because at the end of the day we all go to our separate homes after practice and we go to our separate rooms when we're on the road.  So I don't know how much scrolling goes on.\r\nBut if I have some words of advice, if you're a part of it and it bothers you, then you probably should just delete it off your phone.  That would be if it bothers you.\n",
  "Q. Now that you've had some time to reflect on the call and you're not in the moment, what is your reaction to the change from the charge to the block?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I thought I read that play just as well as I read any play in my career, defensively.  I seen the drive, I was outside the charge line, I stepped in, took the contact.  It's a huge play.  It's a huge play.\nQ. Obviously in the moment there was an expression of frustration with JR the way the game ended.  What can be said now that you have to move past Game 1 and lift him up to get that play out of his mind?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: We got to move on.  This game is over and done with.  We had opportunities.  I would never give up on JR.  That's not my MO.  I don't give up on any of my players, any of my teammates, so I don't think that even needs to be said.\nQ. Did he say anything to you guys?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: No, he didn't.\nQ. First off, how is your eye doing?  Kind of what happened on that play?  The second question, for the players that haven't been in the NBA Finals or your teammates that haven't been in the NBA Finals before, what is your message to them after such a tough Game 1 loss?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: My eye's been better.  It's pretty much blurry, and it kind of got worse and worse as the game went on, after I drove and Draymond poked me right square in the eye.  So I'll deal with that over the next couple days.\r\nI don't think a message needs to be said.  We're in the fight now.  The Finals have started, and they've got a great taste of it tonight.  They know what to expect when we play again.\nQ. The referees' pool report they said they had doubt as to whether you were in the restricted area and that's why it was reviewed.  Did you think you were close to the restricted area, number one?  And number two, how many times have you seen, when they go to review, reverse that kind of call?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Like I said, I read that play just as well as I've read any play in my career, maybe in my life.  I seen the play happening.  I knew I was outside the charge line, and I knew I took the hit.  I don't know what else to say.\nQ. You have a long track record of bringing your A-game to the NBA Finals.  I mean, this is your eighth year, you scored 51 points.  What contributions from your teammates do you think really brought your game to the next level?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I just try to do whatever it takes to help our team win and try to be a triple threat out on the floor offensively and being able to score, rebound, and get my guys involved.  So I just tried to do that tonight.\nQ. As the officials huddle on that call, are you guys being told what they're even reviewing?  Did you have any idea of what it was that could trigger it, or did you know that's what they were going through?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: No, we were told they were reviewing if I had my feet outside the line.  And when I knew that, I was like, okay, that's going to be our ball.  I knew I was outside the charge line, so that's what the communication was to us.  We were over on the sideline, drawing up a play, you know, to try to execute, try to go up a couple possessions.\nQ. How tough is it like mentally for you?  I mean, you shot so well today, you were 19 for 32, you had 51, to recover in just a couple days and get ready for Game 2 after working so hard and playing -- your team playing so well today and just not coming out on top?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I mean, we take this one.  We understand how difficult and how challenging this task is.  You take it all the way throughout the night thinking about it and ways you could have been better and plays that could have happened that could have gone your way and didn't go your way or things you could have done, and you wake up tomorrow with a fresh mind and you move forward.\nQ. What in your view kind of happened late with Steph and Klay after your block, and then after that with the Livingston and Tristan Thompson stuff?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't know.\nQ. I know there will be adjustments, but do you take any consolation when it seemed like you had a good plan, the young guys seemed to handle the moment?  Do you take any consolation in that?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I do not.  I do not.\nQ. Would you say that this is probably the most frustrated or disappointed you've been coming off a Finals game knowing that you were right there and you had many opportunities to end?  Is this probably more frustrated than you've been after a loss?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Because it's right now, I would say yeah.  I always live in the present.  I don't know how frustrated I was after a loss in the past.  I think we played as well as -- tonight we played as well as we've played all postseason, and we gave ourselves a chance possession after possession after possession.  There were just some plays that were kind of taken away from us.  Simple as that.\nQ. From listening to everybody's reaction to the play at the end with JR getting the rebound, there is still confusion whether JR thought the game was tied or whether he thought you guys were ahead.  From where you stood on the court and from talking to him after the play, what's your reaction to it?  What is your version?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: What do you mean what's my version?\nQ. Well, did he think the game was tied or did he think you guys had it salted away?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: How do I know that?\nQ. Did you discuss it at all with him at the end of the play?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: No, they asked me if I talked to JR about it.  I said no already.  I knew it was a tie game.  We were down 1.  George Hill went up, he made the first one.  We got the offensive rebound, you know, I thought we were all aware of what was going on.  That's my view.  So I don't know what JR was thinking.  I don't know the question you're trying to ask.\nQ. I was just trying to see if you knew exactly what his state of mind was.  Did he think that you guys had it won, or did you think he was trying to make a play?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: No.\nQ. What do you mean?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: No, I don't know his state of mind.\n",
  "Q. What's the last couple of days for you been like, just as you go through the process of resetting the body and the mind?  And kind of along those lines, I know that the numbers that you put up so far in these playoffs, everyone's just sort of been gaga over them.  But do you think there's still another level that you can get to in this series?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I really think that's to be seen.  But for the last couple days, obviously, we were able to finish our series off on Sunday in Boston.  Monday was Memorial Day, so I got an opportunity to stay home with the family, barbecue, have a cookout, kids had a heck of a time.  I had a heck of a time just kind of relaxing and decompressing, until 9:00 Eastern Time.  Until I started watching the game and seeing who we were going to play.\r\nJust going against the Warriors in the last three years in The Finals, I kind of figured or thought that they could get it done.  Just because of the 18 of a possible 21 Finals games that I've played against them in the last three years, I figured out that they could make it happen.  Just their championship DNA.\r\nSo yesterday, just round-the-clock treatment.  We had a workout before we left Cleveland.  I got treatment on the four-and-a-half-hour flight up here.  We did a little prep yesterday.  Got some more treatment, ate dinner.  I woke up this morning, worked out like I always do.  I got some more treatment and headed here to see you guys.\r\nThe level that I can play at is to be seen, but the level that I put into the game and put into my craft is who I am.  So numbers and things like that kind of take care of itself.  But for me, I understand and I know how much I put into the game.  So everything else is OK.\nQ. You have four teammates who once played against you deep into the playoffs previously, Kyle Korver, George Hill, Kendrick Perkins and Jeff Green.  Did you ever envision playing on the same team as those guys at some point?  Did you want to?  And the last part of that, what do you like about having Perk around?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: When you go against guys, you can envision at times how they fit with you and what they could do for your team.  Going against Kyle, I always kind of was like, oh, wow, to add a sharpshooter like that to our ballclub would be an amazing thing.  Obviously our former GM, David Griffin, was able to pull that off and get him to us.  And the rest is history, what he's been able to do for our ballclub.\r\nI've always loved George Hill -- his length and his ability to put pressure on the defense, but also on the defensive side with his length.  I've always kind of seen that, obviously, with the battles that we had with Indiana and going deep into the playoffs.\r\nMe and Perk, we've been playing against each other and with each other since high school.  We played on a few AAU circuits together when we played actually for the Oakland Soldiers out here.  We played on the same team.\r\nJeff Green, I never envisioned being a teammate of his.  But I've always kind of had aspirations for Jeff, especially when he went through the heart surgery.  To see the game be taken away from someone so young at that point in time, I was like, wow, this is a reset for me personally to kind of never take the game for granted, even though I never do.  But it gives you an opportunity to kind of think the situation that you're in.\r\nSo it was always great to compete against Jeff, especially after he was able to get back on the floor.  Not actually knowing exactly what he went through, because none of us can actually know unless we've been through that, but you can be inspired by it.  So it's been great to have all four of them.\r\nTo answer your last question, Perk's leadership, his championship, not only pride, but his championship manner, every day he just brings a championship guy around every single day.  Obviously, if you guys are out here, you hear from the Warriors all the time about what it means to be a championship person and to breathe and to talk and to speak that every single day.\r\nFor a lot of our guys that kind of went on to other teams or are not a part of our team this year, it's great to have another championship guy in our locker room that can kind of give some of the guys that have never been a part of it some words of encouragement, or words of advice, or what it takes to breathe a championship mindset every single day.  So he's been instrumental to us since we got him back at the start of postseason.\nQ. Is it good for the NBA to have the same two teams in The Finals four years in a row?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: You've got to ask Adam Silver.\nQ. I mean, your thoughts?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: What?\nQ. Well, there's been some blow-back, some talk on social media that people are sick of the same match-up.  Do you feel like it would be better if there was more parity in the league?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Teams have had their opportunities to beat the Cavs over the last four years, and teams have had the opportunities to beat the Warriors over the last four years.  If you want to see somebody else in the postseason, then you got to beat them.  Or in The Finals, in that case.\nQ. Andre Iguodala, obviously he's out.  What has he done so well on you, or what have you noticed him doing on defense against you the last few years that's kind of making you take notice?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I think it's, first of all, he has very, very quick hands.  That doesn't get talked about a lot.  His ability to react to the ball either in the flight or while you're dribbling or while you pick the ball up.\r\nBut at the end of the day, his athleticism allows him to play some of the premier perimeter players in our league.  He's a guy that's 6'8\", long wingspan, athletic.  He's been like that since he was at Arizona.  He's just added to his game every single season he's been in the NBA.\r\nI've played against him throughout my career, throughout his entire career since he got to the league.  A funny story, when he got drafted, we were one pick away from drafting him before Philly took him (with the ninth pick).  I believe, 8 or 9.  Then we selected Luke Jackson from Oregon.  I had loved him at Arizona and was hoping that he slid to us with that pick.  You guys like those stories, so that's why I gave it to you.\nQ. We appreciate it.\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Yeah, you guys like stories like that (laughing).\nQ. Thursday's going to be the 101st game you've played in this regular season plus the postseason, the most you've ever done in that span of time.  We've tried to get you to kind of reflect on it before; I don't know if you will now.  But are you redefining what a prime is considered?  I mean, in basketball circles for years, you hit seven or eight seasons in, 27 years old, that was kind of the traditional prime.  But now you're 15 years in at age 33 and about to play more basketball than you've ever played.\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Yeah, they always kind of talked about the NBA prime is like 27 and like 31, 32.  That's, if you're lucky, you'll get to that point.\r\nI don't know.  I've just never really bought into that.  I've never bought into a ceiling either.  You guys talked about what's your ceiling, and I've always kind of told you guys that I don't really have a ceiling.  I want to just try to maximize as much as I can and be as good as I can.\r\nI forgot -- I'm not quite sure who I did a postgame interview with after one of our games this year.  I don't know if it was maybe Doris (Burke) or -- it was one of the great lady sideline reporters that we have that asked me how do you feel and how are you still able to do this?  And I told her at that particular time, this is the best I've felt in my career.\nQ. It was Cassidy Hubbarth.\r\nLEBRON JAMES: OK, well, there it is.  I don't know if she believed me, and I don't know if you guys believe me, but I really felt that.  And I continue to just play at an all-time-level standard for the rest of this season.  Hopefully I can continue it in this Finals also.\r\nI've been blessed to be available.  That's what I take pride in more than anything, is being available to my teammates every single day.\r\nI think I've missed one or two practices a (year) because when you live in northeast Ohio and you have four seasons, you will get sick.  But I've been available for my teammates and been a leader to my teammates all year, and I've put in the work.\r\nIt's allowed me to be able to tomorrow suit up for the 101st consecutive time.  If I'm fortunate, I can suit up for -- what is it, 108?  We'll see what happens.\nQ. Does that feeling still apply, even with Larry Nance falling into your leg and playing 94 minutes to close out Games 6 and 7?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I'm not going to answer that.\nQ. A few years back you used to talk about certain teams or certain players having CliffsNotes.  There will probably be CliffsNotes when your career is said and done in your possible book or whatnot, with the Warriors time, tenure.  How impactful and meaningful is this series and rivalry with you in your career?  How do you view them?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Listen, Golden State is one of the best teams I've ever played.  It's one of the best teams that's ever been assembled.  Then they added Kevin Durant.  So then what does that do to them?  It makes them even more dangerous and even more powerful and great.\r\nFor me as a competitor, it's fun.  It's truly fun to know when I'm done playing the game of basketball to know that I played against some of the greatest teams that ever played, ever been assembled.  And this is one of them.\r\nYou look at it, they've got four Hall of Famers on their team in Klay, Dray, Steph and K.D.  They've got a Finals MVP (Andre Iguodala) that comes off their bench.  They've got a number one draft pick, or I think -- what was Shaun Livingston?  One or two when he came out (fourth pick in 2004)?  Fought back, and he comes off their bench.  They've got an All-Star power forward in David West who comes off their bench.\r\nYou know, it's just like whoever they kind of suit up or whoever they decide to be a part of what they've got going on over here is just a really, really high IQ basketball player and knows how to play the game of basketball.\r\nAt what chapter will the LeBron versus Warriors fit into my book?  I have no idea.  That's for myself and whatever writer I decide to pick.  I know one of you guys would love to be (laughing).  Probably could make a lot of money.\r\nBut I don't know.  I could sit here and say today -- listen, Golden State is a great team.  They're a great team, and it's not even -- I didn't even mention their head coach.  Their head coach is the one who kind of puts it all together, makes it all flow.  To be able to put egos and the right position and spot on the floor where everybody feels good about the outcome and things of that nature -- when it comes to team sports, that's something that you would hope that you could be a part of.  When you've got great guys that not only have great talent but also practice the way exactly how you're supposed to practice and then go in a game and play it that way.\r\nI've been fortunate enough to be a part of a few of those teams in my career, either from NBA teams or Olympic teams, obviously.\r\nI don't know.  I don't know where they will fall in my book, but they will have a nice chapter.\n",
  "Q. I know every season's different, every series is different, but two years ago you sat at your locker for 45 minutes with a towel over your head after the game ended.  Tonight you're in here already.  Can you go through your emotions in the moment and how -- it sounds silly, how this feels.\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, for me personally, I left everything on the floor every game, all five games.  So for me personally I have nothing to be -- I have no reason to put my head down.  I have no reason to look back at what I could have done or what I shouldn't have done or what I could have done better for the team.  I left everything I had out on the floor every single game for five games in this Finals, and you come up short.\nSo it would be the same if you feel like you wrote the best column of you your life and somebody picked another one over you.  That's -- how would you feel?  You know, so you wouldn't hold your head down, but you would be like, okay, it's just not my time.\nSo Golden State is a worthy opponent, obviously been the best team in our league for the last three years, the best team this year, and they showcased that throughout the post-season, and we were another opponent in their way.\nIt's just unfortunate for some of the guys on our team that's never been able to get this far and not be able to hold the trophy up.  And those are things that kind of bother me more than anything.  Guys like Kyle and Derrick and Deron and Kay and Edy.  So, emotions are all over the place right now.\nQ. You guys are obviously competitors, you think you can overcome everything.  Was there ever a point in this series where you felt overmatched, like you weren't going to be able to do this?\nLEBRON JAMES: No, I don't think I've ever -- not one time did I feel like we were overmatched until probably like I looked up, there was like a minute 20, and we were down 13, I believe, or something at that point.  And I was like, okay, we left everything on the floor, and it still wasn't enough.\nSo that's -- they assembled a great team.  We were able to get them last year, and they went out and got one of the best players that this league has ever seen, so they did a good job of -- a great job, their front office and their players, by doing that recruiting, the things that they did in the summertime, and obviously it paid dividends.\nQ. 32 years old, 14 years in the league, and now there's this team out West that has won two championships the last three years.  How do you view them when you look at what's your future in the league?\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, it's a two-sided question because for me personally -- I don't know.  I need to sit down and figure this thing out.  And so I don't know as far as me personally right now.\nBut as far as that team, they're going to be here for a while.  They're going to be around for a while.  Pretty much all their guys are in their 20s.  Pretty much all their big-name guys are in their 20s, and they don't show any signs of slowing down.\nSo there's going to be a lot of teams that's trying to figure out ways to put personnel together to try and match that if they're able to actually face them in the Playoff series, both Eastern Conference and Western Conference.  Because they're built for -- from my eyes, they're built to last a few years.  So we'll see.\nQ. You said you have a sense of history about this.  You averaged a triple-double in The Finals, never been done before.  You referenced maybe the best.  Was this your best series you've ever played?\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't know.  This is my 8th trip to the Finals, and I've had some pretty good ones in my day.  And like I said, I just try to do everything to just try to help this team win and more.  For me to go out there and for the guys that allowed me to be the leader that I am and allow me and trust me that I'm going to make the right plays and I'm going to do the right things and have the right intention, that's a compliment to a my guys, it's a compliment to the 14 guys that allow me to do at that and the coaching staff.\nAnd I just try to put in the work.  I put in the work individually, in the film room, in my mind, my body every single day to prepare myself for whatever obstacle that this ball club entails.  Does it always result in us winning?  No.  This is my third year here, and we haven't won every game.  We haven't won every Finals, obviously.  We lost two of them.\nSo but like I've always told myself, if you feel like you put in the work and you leave it out on the floor, then you can always push forward and not look backwards.\nQ. You mentioned all the energy you exert, and obviously you worked so hard.  What do you plan on doing to get away from the game for a little while, and how long before you recharge your batteries and get back at it?\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't know.  I probably won't stop working out.  I think it's just a lifestyle for me.  So I probably will be back in my gym in the next couple days just because it's just who I am.\nAs far as being back on the basketball court, I'm going to take a while.  I don't need to be back on the basketball court right now.  I need to get off of my feet and let my joints and let my body kind of recover from being out on the floor for 14 straight years.\nSo but I'll train.  I'll train all summer.  It's just a part of who I am now, just a part of my lifestyle.\nQ. Five years ago you broke through, got your first championship against Kevin Durant.  Having those burdens and those expectations to finally achieve it, I'm wondering if you could offer your perspective what you think it must be like for him, having experienced something like that yourself?\nLEBRON JAMES: It's a great feeling.  When you're able to work hard, you're able to put in the work and accomplish a feat like that, it's something that we all dream about.  Growing up in our inner cities, a lot of hard work and through high school, through college, if you went to college, and through the NBA, you always hope that you will be in a position to be able to not only compete for a championship but win a championship, and it's a great feeling.\nQ. Obviously you can't control where free agents go and teams get stacked or whatnot.  How you would you look back at this season?  How can you assess this season?\nLEBRON JAMES: Our team, our ball club?\nQ. Yes.\nLEBRON JAMES: We had some good times.  We had some bad times.  We had some times where -- the biggest thing of this season is we weren't able to get healthy.  When we finally got healthy, the Playoffs was right around the corner.  And we showed what we're capable of doing when we got a full unit.  It would have been great to see us at a full unit throughout the whole season so we can continue to build and build the camaraderie and build the chemistry out on the floor so you don't have to wait until April to see what you're capable of doing.\nAnd, yes, we were able to hit the switch, but those games in January, those games in November, games that people think that's not important, they're important to me, and they would have been important to our ball club.\nBut, whatever, we figured it out and got to the post-season as a two seed.  We controlled home court and were able to win on the road in the Eastern Conference Finals in Boston, and we were able to punch our clock into competing for a championship.  And as a ball club and as an individual, that's all you want, is an opportunity.\nNow, obviously, we ran against, like I said, a worthy opponent, one of the best Playoff teams that this league has ever seen, obviously, and we weren't able to get over the hump and accomplish what we ultimately wanted to do.  But it's no such thing as a failed season when you put in as much work as we have done individually and as a ball club since September.  Since late September.\nQ. You just said I need to take some time and sit down and figure this thing out, big picture, Warriors, all of that.  Does it feel like the puzzle pieces are out there, you just can't see them yet?\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I don't know.  I'm not a -- I'm not the GM of the team.  I'm not in the front office, but I know our front office is going to continue to try to put our ball club, put our franchise in a position where we can compete for a championship year in and year out.\nLike I said, teams and franchises are going to be trying to figure out ways that they can put personnel together, the right group of guys together to be able to hopefully compete against this team.  They're assembled as good as you can assemble, and I played against some really, really good teams that was assembled perfectly, and they're right up there.\nSo we will see, but I will get away from the game a little bit, probably watch some WNBA games, though.  Can't get away from it.  I'll probably watch -- my son's tournament is this summer, so I'll be a part of the game.  But as far as me actually playing, I won't.  I won't be a part of the game much this summer.\nQ. You've been a part of two super teams, the one you have here, the one you had in Miami, looking at what the Golden State Warriors have done, are you still a fan of the concept?  Do you think it's a good thing for the NBA to build these teams how they brought in Kevin?  You get what I'm asking?\nLEBRON JAMES: No, not really.  I don't believe I've played for a super team.  I don't believe in that.  I don't believe we're a super team here.  So, no, I don't really, I don't -- you guys want one more question before I leave and not see you guys for a long time?\nQ. It was mentioned before that Kevin Durant lost his first NBA Finals when you won your first NBA Finals.  Kind of fast forwarding to right now, how is he a different player and a different person since you do know him personally, and even though you're -- obviously you're upset because you lost, how do you feel about him winning that first championship?\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I'm not happy he won his first.  I'm not happy at all.  But at the end of the day from when I played him in the 2012 Finals to now, like I said, experience is the best teacher in life, and he's just experiencing and experiencing and experiencing.  And it also helps when you are able to experience some things with this team as well.  He felt like he needed to reassemble and reassess his career and come here.\nSo like I said, having -- getting that first championship for me was like having my first son.  It was just a proud moment, something that you never, ever forget.  And at the end of the day, nobody can -- no matter what anybody says from now on in your career or whatever they say, they can never take away from you being a champion.  That's something that they are always going to speak about, about you.  It may be like the last thing they may say, but they are always going to have to say that you're a champion.\nLike I said, when you put in the work and things pay off, then you can always be okay with whatever else that happens in your career.\n",
  "Q. After Game 3, you were talking about guys had to play A plus plus game to beat this team.  Do you feel like you played A plus plus game last game?\nLEBRON JAMES: I think we have to bring our best game every game against this team.  Like I said before, they create so many different problems out on the floor, so much firepower, that we always have to play great in order to win.  So we have to do that tomorrow night as well.\nQ. If you think back to 2012, the first time you and K.D. faced off in The Finals and what you see now, how different is he individually and how different is just the context of the kind of team he's playing with now versus what was obviously a pretty young Thunder team?\nLEBRON JAMES: I think the difference is that they were just a younger team.  I think we had a little bit more experience.  Obviously we had a couple guys that had already won championships.  Derek Fisher maybe had been the only guy, or Perk [Kendrick Perkins].  So they had a couple guys that won championships too, but I think Russ [Westbrook] and K.D. and James [Harden] were just younger.\nI think, like I always tell you guys with my personal experience, experience is the best teacher.  Then you're able to align his experience that he's had over his career since 2012 with Steph, Klay, Draymond and this organization.  It excels your experience as well.  So that's definitely helped.\nQ. Are you guys on each other a lot more in this series than you would have been?  I assume you guys are on each other a lot more now?\nLEBRON JAMES: We have been on each other a lot throughout these first four games.  It's probably going to stay that way, especially tomorrow, and we'll see what happens after that.\nQ. Is it even possible to overstate how much more of a challenge it is playing a Game 5 in the NBA Finals when the other team has Draymond and K.D., unlike last year?\nLEBRON JAMES: It's the same challenges.  Especially being in this building.  We knew coming into the Game 5 last year if we don't protect the ball, we don't limit their three-point shooting, then we can get blown out the window and blown out of this arena.\nIt's the same way.  If we don't protect the three-point line and if we turn the ball over, then we don't stand a chance.  So we know what our keys to victory is.  That's going to give us the best possible chance to go back home with a Game 6.  And if we don't stick to stick to that game plan, then we'll be going back home without a game.\nQ. Game 4 aside, Stephen Curry's had a great Playoffs, great Finals.  What have you seen this year as compared to last year when he kind of struggled it seemed as the Playoffs went along?  How aware were you that he was struggling last year?\nLEBRON JAMES: It's never been my concern about who's been struggling or who's been playing well.  We have keys, and our keys is to limit certain guys.  You can't take away everything from great players, and Steph is one of those players.  You can't take away everything, just try to make it tough on them.\nLike I said the last years, the year before, the beginning of this series, you have to try to make it tough on him.  He's going to make shots.  He's going to make plays not only for himself but for his teammates.  Just try to make it tough on him, and you can live with the results.\nQ. The last time you were right here, same situation, down 3-1, similar colors you were wearing last year as well.  Does anything come to your mind, like any memories come to your mind about that time at that juncture?\nLEBRON JAMES: No, not really.  It's different for me.  It's always been a different experiences and different challenges.  And for me it's just trying to get my mind focused on the game tomorrow.  Which I will.  We'll have a great practice today.  We'll go over some things that we need to do better in Game 5, and then it's just going out and play.  I put in the homework.  I've got my mind ready for these games.  I got my body prepared.  And if I leave everything out on the floor, then I'm happy with the results.\nQ. When Kyrie is going the way he has been the last couple games, how does that open up things for the rest of the offense?\nLEBRON JAMES: We love how aggressive Kyrie's been, and it's been great for our team, obviously, with his individual ability to make shots and to take big shots and to knock them down.  That's been key for our team.  And for the rest of us, we have to do everything else.  We have to defend, rebound, set screens for him.  We have to get him looks when he's got it going.  We have to set great screens for him to get him going and things of that nature.  So we hopefully can continue that tomorrow.\nQ. What do you think of the job R.J. has done on K.D. in this series?  His minutes seem to be going up every night.  And what does that change for you defensively and how does that allow you to play defensively when R.J. takes Kevin?\nLEBRON JAMES: You have to give great scorers different looks.  If you give K.D. and Steph a steady diet of the same guy every single possession, then they're going to figure it out.  They are already great, so they're going to figure it out even more.\nSo to be able to just put different bodies on K.D. -- myself, R.J., Swish [J.R. Smith] at times, Shump as well; the same with Steph, Kyrie and Swish and myself and Shump, and give him different looks, just to try to keep him off balance as much as you can.  But I think R.J.'s done a great job and he's just stuck to the game plan.\nK.D.'s obviously an exceptional offensive player, exceptional player, and he's going to make big shots.  He's going to take shots, but just got to try to make it tough on him and limit it as much as you can.\nQ. You touched on earlier about turnovers and guarding the three-point line and all that.  The three games here this year have not been close.  You've lost all three by double figures, but obviously you won the two here in the Playoffs last year, so how much stock do you put in the first three games here in this building this season and how much do you rely on winning two playoff games here last year?\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't put any on any regular-season game this year.  They're not the same team.  We don't prepare the same way.  I don't put anything on the regular-season game.  But we didn't play well in Game 1 or Game 2.  So we have watched the film, we see what we didn't do well.  And if you don't do something well, they will make you pay for it.  So we have to be 20 times better in this building, and we understand that.\nQ. You told us The Finals are a stressful experience to go through.  Getting that one win under your belt, does that change the pressure at all?  Does it change kind of the mental makeup of your team going into Game 5?\nLEBRON JAMES: Not for me.  The Playoffs is stressful and just the preparation, things of that nature, but that's just from how I prepare.  There's no added stress going on playing basketball.  Your coaching staff giving you a game plan, you just try to execute it.  There's no added stress of that.\nIf you're able to get a win or get two, get three, get four, you don't win, I guess I've been a part of all of it.  I don't think you have more stress.  You know what you need to do.  If you're prepared, then you're prepared.  There's no reason to add more to it.\nQ. The Warriors obviously just came through here and listening to them they sounded a lot like you guys after Game 1.  They just said over and over again about how poorly they felt they played.  Was that your takeaway at all from Game 4, that the Warriors were less than what they are, and what do you expect to see from them tomorrow night?\nLEBRON JAMES: I just think we stick to our keys in Game 4.  We stuck to our keys.  That is all I can say.  I don't think they played poorly.  I think they came in with a game plan and we came in with a game plan and we happened to get that one.  I don't think we played poorly in Game 3.  But they just played better than us and they got that one.  So for us if we come in with our mindset of the game plan that our coaching staff will give us, we stick to it as close to 48 minutes as possible.  And does it give you a win?  No, but it gives us the best shot.\nQ. Do you feel like they feel like this is the game they have to get?\nLEBRON JAMES: No, I feel like this is the game we got to get.  Or it's over with.  I think everybody's feeling that way.\nQ. Did you guys feel like JR had to shoot more, he had to score more points to beat this team?  And have you passed the ball off the backboard to yourself before?\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, JR is a big piece of your offensive package and our defensive package.  We just feel like when he gets looks, he needs to take them.  And he's done that the last few games.  He's come up big for us offensively.  We have needed everything from him.\nI've passed the ball off the backboard to myself before and, yeah, I've done it before.  I don't have anything else to say about that.\nQ. Back in the day people were shocked, I think [Tom] Heinsohn was maybe the first one to do it.\nLEBRON JAMES: Oh, that's a while ago.\nQ. But nobody had seen it before.  They were laughing about it.\nLEBRON JAMES: That's good.\nQ. You said last week you thought the Warriors team coming together was good for basketball, the way that they have put their team together.  Do you have any sense, knowing the history of the game, that people are perceiving this differently for some reason?  Because there's always been great teams put together in NBA history?\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I can see it from both sides.  Not going to exactly give you my opinion on how I can see it from both sides.  I will at some point in my career.  I'm not at that point right now because I know what I say kind of gets -- people take it the wrong way.  So I have my opinion on how people see it from both sides, and I have pretty good knowledge about it.  So a few years from now I'll tell you how I really feel about the whole situation.\nBut they're a great team.  They're assembled as good as you can be as a professional team, and they're on a quest to win a championship.  You can respect that.\nQ. They're adding three-on-three to the Olympics, and I just was hoping to get your quick thoughts on that and whether you would ever consider playing that and any other thoughts?\nLEBRON JAMES: First of all, I think it's great for basketball.  For us to be able to add another category to the Olympics, another basketball category, I think it's pretty great.  I haven't seen the full layout of how they plan on executing it and are they going to use NBA guys are they going to use college guys.  I'm not quite sure.\nI'm not very good in a three-on-three thing.  I'm more of a five-on-five guy.  I stay out of the one-on-one matchups during our practice, the two-on-twos and the three-on-threes.\nSo probably not.  I probably won't be a part of the three-on-three matchup that it has to offer.\n",
  "Q. Just wondering if you could take us through kind of what was going through your head and how the play developed, the one where you went off the glass yourself.\nLEBRON JAMES: I think I was -- it was a transition play, and I believe it was Kyle on my right side that was running the wing, and two of their players were back and I was just trying to engage one of them so I could get Kyle a shot in the corner, and they both went to Kyle, I believe, and I got caught in the air.  So that's the only thing I could think of.  I didn't want to travel, and Draymond was kind of playing Double T, and Double T kind of had his back towards me, so I just threw it off the glass and went and got it.\nQ. The way you guys came out in that first quarter where Tristan is establishing the tone of the game, JR Smith is hitting some big threes, how can you ensure that you bring that same kind of mentality on the road in Oracle and just seeing what you guys were capable of, doing that?\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, we're going to watch the film when we get to Golden State, and let's see ways we can be better.  We didn't play our type of game in Game 1 and Game 2.  And if we don't do that, if we play like we played in Game 1 and Game 2 of this series, the series is over.  So we have to continue to play how we played at home.  We have to be physically -- be physical at the point of attack, we got to continue to move the ball, share the ball.  And tonight we had 27 assists, and that's very key.\nQ. The first three games you guys kind of struggled from beyond the arc, hit 24 tonight.  Just how different of a team are you guys when you're just knocking those perimeter shots down?\nLEBRON JAMES: That's part of who we are.  We set a lot of records since we kind of assembled this team the last couple years.  And that's just part of who we are.  We got guys that can stretch the floor, make big shots, and they did it tonight, from Ky, Kevin, and Swish, and everybody else chipped in as well.\nQ. Did you talk with your teammates before the game and just stress like we're not going out like that, something along those lines?\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I didn't hear it, but some of the other guys heard it and told me that that they wanted to celebrate on our floor once again and they wanted to spray champagne in our locker rooms, and I think it came from Draymond, which is okay, that's Dray anyway.\nBut so I just told guys, I didn't stress anything besides just live in the moment.  Live in the moment.  We have a great opportunity to give ourself another opportunity to keep going.  We played well in Game 3, well enough to win, and we just didn't do it.  But tonight we came out and we stuck to the game plan our coaching staff put together and we -- this was as close to a 48-minute game we played in the post-season.  Even in the first couple first three rounds, this was close as -- to a 48-minute game as we played.  It was big for us.\nQ. How important is that, that everybody standing out for the game, and also do you finally feel that tonight you guys are who you are?\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I think the last two games we have played Cavaliers basketball.  We have been physical, we haven't turned the ball over, and we have shared the ball.  In Game 3 we just -- down the stretch we couldn't make any shots, and they did.  And that was just -- it's a make-or-miss league at that point.\nSo in the last couple games we have been playing Cavaliers basketball, and it's resulted in us just playing better and us getting this win tonight.\nQ. Kind of looks like d\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a9j\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a0 vu all over again, you guys going back west down 3-1.  Do you have these guys just where you want them?\nLEBRON JAMES: No, they got us where they want us.  Listen, at the end of the day, we want to just try to put ourself in position to play another game, and we did that tonight and hopefully we can do it Monday night where we can come back here.\nSo our mindset is try to go up there and get one.  Which is probably one of the toughest environments we have in this league, along with our building.  And so we look forward to the challenge and the matchup.\nQ. 40 more tonight for Kyrie, LeBron, coming off of the difficult end to Game 3, big performance from him, did you feel that he was going to be able to bounce back in a big way after that tough end to Game 3, and what else did you see from him tonight?\nLEBRON JAMES: He's just been very special in closeout games.  On both sides.  Us being able to close out a team trying to close out on us.  He's just been built for that moment.  I said that over and over again, that he's always been built for the biggest moments, and tonight he showed that once again.  It's not surprising.  He's just that special.\nQ. Whether it's adversity or desperation or intensity, this group, as we have seen it the last couple of years, seems to always respond to it.  What is in your guys' makeup that allows you to only have that really come out in these situations?\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't know.  I don't like it.\n(Laughter.)\nIt causes too much stress, man.  I'm stressed out.  Keep doing this every year.  But listen, at the end of the day we just got some resilient guys.  The Warriors have championship DNA, and we do as well.  We're battle tested, they're battle tested.  And getting swept is something that you never want to have happen.  Especially this point.  You get all the way to the Finals, you hate to get swept, lose two games on your home floor.  So I think a lot of guys had that in their mind today, and they came out and played like it.\nQ. Physically, are you okay?  We saw you getting some treatment after the game.\nLEBRON JAMES: I'll be all right on Monday.  I'll be all right on Monday.\nQ. Couple of years back, obviously, Andy was kind of that spark plug energy-wise.  How different is it now when Tristan can play the game that he was able to play tonight versus last three games, from just a collective team-wide energy standpoint?\nLEBRON JAMES: He's a big piece of our puzzle.  We all know that.  He's been huge for our success the last three years, and they did a -- they have done a great job of putting him in the game plan and neutralizing what he does best, and that's offensive rebound and giving us extra possessions.  And it's been very tough on him in this Finals so far.  But he didn't get down on himself.  He came through when we needed him the most, and that was tonight, getting 10 rebounds and also dishing out five assists.  So that was big time.\nQ. He's a professional, but you've referred to him before as your little brother.  Have you had any talks with him over the last three games after any sort of frustration or struggles in regard to being ready for Game 4?\nLEBRON JAMES: Yeah, I have.  I'm not here to tell you guys what I've been talking to him about or what I -- but he knows what I expect out of him.  Like I said, tonight we needed him the most, and he was there.\nQ. After Game 3 being such a letdown, did you have to work into believing that something like tonight was possible?  And if you did, when did you get to that point?\nLEBRON JAMES: No, I didn't have to work into believing it.  At the end of the day I had the same game day ritual.  And I slept great last night, came to shootaround, got my work in, I went home, took my usual pregame nap, got up, ate my pregame food, came to work.\nI didn't feel anything, actually, I was just excited about the moment.  It is what it is.  You come to work and you put in the work and you study the game for myself, and you just do everything to put yourself in a position to succeed.\nThere's no reason to add any more pressure to it.  And I'm not saying it was the result of a win, because I've done the same thing for a long time now, but for myself, just being able to just stay even keeled no matter the situation, I think it's good for our ball club.\nQ. This game lasted almost three hours and you had a triple double.  This game had a little bit of everything.  Do you feel as emotionally and mentally drained as you did the last game when you guys lost?\nLEBRON JAMES: I'm about there.  I'm about there.  It lets me know that I did what I was supposed to do when I'm emotionally and physically drained at the end of a Finals game.  If I'm not, then I didn't do what I was supposed to do.  So that would be two games in a row where I felt like that, and now I got to get my mind ready once again.\nQ. The NBA life means a lot of traveling.  Do you have a particular routine on the plane?  How do you maximize your rest?\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, it's quite a long flight going out west, and so we try to get a little bit of sleep.  I try to get a little bit of sleep and then I get up and get treatment on the plane.  Just give my body as much treatment as I can on the plane and get a couple hours of rest.  Obviously it's going to be probably not too -- it won't be a long -- it won't be easy for me to sleep tonight because I'm still going on with the game and things of that nature, my body is not feeling as great, but I'll be fine tomorrow.\nQ. How did your approach to the game and your style of play evolve between the first Final you played in and this one?\nLEBRON JAMES: I stunk in the first Finals.  I don't stink anymore.\nQ. Kyrie was in here and he said that he always is looking at social media.  He says he sees everything.  You've talked about a lot of times about how you're past that, you don't listen to critics and everything.  Do you talk to your teammates when all of this stuff is kind of floating around about curses and Cavs in seven tweets that kind of go viral on social media about kind of pushing that stuff away?\nLEBRON JAMES: No, I don't see it.  So I can't talk to my teammates about it because I don't see it.  Unless one of the guys brings it to me, either as a joke or something they want me to see, but I don't -- it don't go -- I don't have notifications on my phone.  I don't have none of the apps on my phone right now so I can't even like click on it and accidentally click on it.  I don't get involved in that, man.  Because I'm like, I know, like I'm like every other mention when I play.  And I don't -- I don't like it because people just be talking like -- people talk crazy, man.  I'm going to leave it at that.  So I know better.\nQ. Tonight's game was so physical, and also dramatic.  How do you guys make it to focus on basketball and not to be distracted and especially keep the lead?\nLEBRON JAMES: At the end of the day the game is supposed to be played physically.  Both teams were wanting to put themselves in the record books and put themselves in basketball history.  So try to do whatever it takes to win.  I think both teams definitely are trying to do that from game to game.\nQ. Just your reaction to that first quarter, first half, both record setting.  I mean, you came within a free throw of 50 for a quarter and 80 whatever it was at half.  Did you have a minute to think about what was going on?\nLEBRON JAMES: No.  You can't.  First of all, if you take a minute to see what's going on versus this team, they hit you with a 50-point quarter.  There's no -- you can't -- we were just playing in the moment.  We're just playing good basketball.  We were in attack mode, and it results in us having 49.  The reason we didn't hit 50 is because I can't shoot a free throw.  So, but I'll be better in Game 5.\n",
  "Q. You spoke yesterday about going immediately home and getting the treatment because it was a physically and emotionally stressful game for you.  How are you feeling right now, and do you feel like the quick turnaround is an advantage for you to get back on the court or kind of a disadvantage because you need a little more rest?\nLEBRON JAMES: Before I answer your question, I just want to send my condolences out to Todd Harris' family.\nSomeone that meant a lot to our league.  I worked with him for so many years.  And that's very sad and dramatic, what happened.  Getting an opportunity to know his wife and his son and his daughter, seeing them all for the last few years.  Every time we played Brooklyn, I saw him in the tunnel taking pictures with the family.  Just always been kind to me.\nAnd when I heard the news -- I haven't been on social media for quite a while now; I didn't even know it happened until when we did the moment of silence yesterday before the game.  That lets you know that this is -- this game is unbelievable, but there are also things much bigger than that.  So my prayers from my family sent out to his family.\nTo answer your question, I've been around the clock getting my body ready for tomorrow, getting my mind ready once again.  And is it an advantage?  I don't know if it's an advantage, after this series, after this postseason, after how many minutes and games I played in.  But I'll be ready to go tomorrow once the game gets here.\nQ. One quick follow-up.  Obviously you guys played a lot better in Game 3.  Now that you had a little bit of time, what did you see out there on the court that's working for you guys and that you think you can bring and carry over to Game 4 to make sure you can complete out and get that game?\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I feel like if we come in with the same energy, same effort, physicality, as we did in Game 3, we give ourselves a good chance to win.  Now, does that result in a win?  It's to see.  Because we played well in Game 3, and they were able to get that one as well.\nSo it was just about us playing the same way, being a little bit better down the stretch, obviously.  But like I said, last night we had some -- I mean, I just watched the film.  We had some pretty good looks that just didn't go down, and they had some looks that went down for them.  So obviously we know it's a big challenge, but we look forward to the matchup again.\nQ. Having changed teams a couple times and knowing how hard it can be, how long it can take for it all to come together, can you appreciate for Kevin maybe, how fortunate maybe he is that it looks like he found a situation for him where it just blends perfectly right and maybe it can be quicker, he can find a fulfillment easier?\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, first of all, with all the success that he's gotten throughout his career, I've always been proud of him and I'm always excited to see him grow as a player.  I don't think that our careers are the same as far as changing teams.  Their team was already kind of put together, and you just implement a guy that's ready to sacrifice, a great talent, a guy that's willing to do whatever it takes to help the team win.\nBut that team, they knew what they were about.  He just had to come in and just do what he had to do.  And that's what he been doing.  For me, when I left here to go to Miami, we had to build something.  We brought in eight or nine guys, and we had to build something.  And when I came back here, we built something again.\nBut I can definitely appreciate the simple fact of him either reshaping his game or just sacrificing maybe some shots here, sacrificing having the ball in his hands all the time.  But it works for their team.  I mean, who wouldn't want to sacrifice playing on a Golden State team or a San Antonio team or a Cleveland team when you know the ultimate result is you can actually compete for a championship.\nQ. We know that you don't put too much importance on almost any one game outside of a Game 7, obviously, but would getting one tomorrow, how important would that be for you, whether it be to stop history, to avoid a sweep, whatever the case?\nLEBRON JAMES: My mindset is to try to get every game.  Tomorrow's another important opportunity for us and for myself, obviously, to continue the series.  It's been a long season, and you hate for it to end this way.  So mentally and physically, I got to prepare myself for that.\nQ. You touched on this a little bit last night, but even before this series you were -- kind of knew this was going to be a tough one.  Having played these guys now three games, is the challenge -- is it different than you anticipated?  What have you learned about the Golden State team?\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, you knew they were resilient, for one.  I watched a lot of film on them, and I knew it was going to be one of the toughest challenges I've had because of the firepower they have, because of the mindset that they were going to have.  And they're a hungry group.  You can sense that.  You've seen that throughout the postseason.  You've seen it for the first three games of The Finals, and they have so much talent, a ton of talent.  And they work well together.  It's not one guy on that team that's selfishly looking for himself and not for the team.\nWhen you can combine talent, you can combine unselfishness, and then you can combine guys that play hard, that's going to result in some really good things.  I sensed that from not only watching the film before the series started but also now playing in the series.\nQ. After watching film now, that possession where after K.D. hit the three, were you comfortable with that?  Is that what you guys were looking for?  It seemed like a lot of time was wasted on that possession?\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, after K.D. hit the three, I think that's where Kyrie missed the jumper, right?  He had it going as far as the one-on-one matchup, and he's an exceptional one-on-one player.\nWe take it.  We take it.  He was pretty down about the shot attempt that he got.  But, listen, like I said, it's a miss-or-make league, and he left everything on the floor.  He did everything he could.  And obviously when you miss the shot, you always are going to say, well, we could have got a better possession.\nBut we live with that.  We live with our star point guard taking a shot that he's capable of making.  He just missed it, and that was the result of it.\nQ. The plus-minus numbers last night with you on the court versus off the court were reflective of some of the numbers we saw throughout the regular season and also reflective of the team's record when you -- playing a game versus not playing a game.  Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals you missed some time, and the Cavs were able to stem the tide.  What can be done moving forward to empower this team to be able to perform at a consistent level when you're taking a break or from a game or from a brief rest in a game?\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't know.  I don't know the answer to that right now.  Obviously I hate the fact that we're not able to -- you know, just try to keep the leads, and if I come out of the game or not, even keep the leads, just sustain it.  I hate it for my teammates, I hate it for myself, I hate it for everybody that's involved.  And last night, it was another one of those instances.  I came out with 1:43 I believe in the first quarter, we were up 31-29, and then they went on a quick 10-0 run.  It's 39-31.  Well, 32 after they reviewed the three that added another point.\nAnd against a team like this, those type of runs you just can't afford.  And like you say, throughout the course of the regular season or throughout the course of the postseason, we just have to find better ways to, as a collective unit, having the right pieces out on the floor or the guys on the floor, they have to do their job, and try to do it at a high level, no matter who is out on the floor.  So something we have to figure out.\nQ. Ten years ago you began your Finals run against a team that was in the midst of a dynasty.  Now you're up against a team that looks like it's built to last.  Does that change the challenge, does that fuel you?  How do you feel about that?\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I think it's just part of my calling to just go against teams in the midst of a dynasty.  This has been the best team in our league the last three years.  They won a championship, and last year it was the greatest regular-season team we had played, probably one of the best postseason teams that everybody's ever seen as well, but we were just able to overcome that.  And they're playing like one of the best teams once again.\nSo like I said, there have been times throughout my career where I just played teams that were just in the midst of something that can last for a long time.  And obviously this team is built to be able to do that with the talent that they have.\nSo we'll see what happens.  Obviously you never know what's going to happen, but as it stands right now, they look pretty good, as far as the future.\nQ. I know you don't like to look too far down the road, but as well as you're playing and as good as you're feeling, have you kind of recalibrated how long you want to stay around?\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't know.  I don't know.  I feel good.  I actually feel better.  I don't feel good right now, but I feel pretty good where my game is right now.  But I don't know.  I don't know.  I haven't really thought about it, how long I want to stay around.  I definitely want to compete.  I want to compete for championships every year, and so we'll see what happens.\nQ. Obviously you're no stranger to criticism, right?  There are some people that feel that with 50 seconds left in the game, you guys up two, they would like to see you kind of force more in those moments to try to score that basket yourself as opposed to dishing it away.  I'm just curious to know what your message to those critics would be.\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't know if you've been here for the last couple years or heard me talk.  I don't even really care.  I had a 101 drives last night.  I didn't have 101, but you get the gist of it.  I'm sorry I didn't go for 102.  But at the end of the day I don't really -- what is a critic?  It doesn't matter.\nOne of my favorite quotes, when I really stopped caring about what people say, is Theodore Roosevelt, The Man in the Arena.  So if you read that, you'll see where I'm at right now in my life.  It doesn't matter to me.\nQ. If you could have the play over again, would you still make that same pass?\nLEBRON JAMES: If I could have the play over again, I would come off a three screen situation.  Draymond would switch on me with five fouls.  I would get him leaning.  I would drive left.  I would see K.D. step up.  I would see Stephen Curry drop on Kevin.  And I would see Kyle Korver in the corner, one of the greatest three-point shooters in this league's history, and give him an opportunity in the short corner.  I would do the same exact thing.\nQ. To your earlier point about K.D., when you changed teams and went to Miami, it was a different time.  In order to get a player of your caliber or Kevin's caliber, you had to pretty much clear the decks and start over.  Now you have a situation where a team is able to be a championship team already and add a player of Kevin's caliber.  Is that good or bad for the league in your opinion?  And for a guy who pours his heart and soul into this, is it fair?\nLEBRON JAMES: Oh, I mean, it's part of the rules.  The difference between my situation is -- well, the best thing with Golden State's situation is a lot of their guys are drafted.  They drafted a lot of their guys.  Three of their best players were already drafted, so they were able to hold on to them because they own the Bird rights, if everybody knows the CBA.  So they're able to keep Steph, Klay and Draymond and able to go out and sign someone else like they did this past summer by just getting rid of a couple pieces in Harrison Barnes and not re-signing Barbosa and Bogut and guys from last year's team.  So that allowed them to go do that.\nMy case, going to Miami, we had to clear a lot of space because they didn't have anybody as far as guys that they wanted to keep as far as Bird rights besides U.D. [Udonis Haslem] and D-Wade.  They had the opportunity to go get two of us, and they did that in me and Bosh, and then we were able to finagle a way to get Mike Miller because some of us took pay cuts, and got some other guys.  We had Rio [Mario Chalmers] because he was drafted.  But it was a different situation.  Totally different.  Totally different.\nBut is it fair?  I don't care.  I mean, I think it's great.  It's great for our league.  Right now, look at our TV ratings, look at the money our league is pouring in.  I mean, guys are loving the game, our fans love the game.  I mean, who am I to say if it's fair or not?  No matter who I'm going against, if I'm going against four Hall of Famers, like I said before the series started with Draymond, Klay, Steph, and K.D., or if I'm going against two or whatever the case may be, I'm always excited to play the game.  And I'm not one to judge and say if it's fair or not if guys are adding players to their team.\nSo that's what you want to do.  Is it fair that the New York Yankees in the '90s was adding piece after piece after piece after piece?  I mean, if you have the opportunity to do that -- is it fair that the Cowboys added Deion Sanders?\nI mean, listen.  It happens.  It's sports.  You have an opportunity to sign one of the best players, and you can do it, go ahead and do it.  Why not?  If I become an owner, I'm going to try to sign everybody.  Appreciate it.\n",
  "Q. Obviously down 3-0, what's the message that you communicate to your team right now in what looks like a pretty perilous situation?\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, we didn't have any -- not many worries after the game.  I'll figure it out within the next 48 hours.  Obviously it's a dramatic situation to be in, but it is what it is and we got to get ready for Game 4.\nSo we're going to come in tomorrow, watch some film, see ways we can get better and just try to take it one game at a time.\nQ. You guys were up six with 3:09 to go.  What stands out to you in the remaining three minutes after that?\nLEBRON JAMES: They made some shots and we didn't.  We had some really good looks.  We had some really good looks.  I had a turnaround jumper in the post fade-away, I make a ton, didn't go in.  Kyle had a corner three, really good look, right in front of their bench, didn't go in.  They came down and Steph, one ricocheted off the backboard, he got a tip in, K.D. got a pull-up on Tristan, and then he shoots a bomb in transition.\nSo it's a miss-or-make league.  We make a couple, they miss a couple, and it's the other way around.  But it didn't happen that way.\nQ. Last year you guys did something that was never done before in the NBA Finals, coming back from 3-1.  Now you have an opportunity to do that again.  Does that give you some confidence, give the team some confidence that, hey, it was something last year that they thought was impossible, now obviously a lot of people are going to be like this is impossible?\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, of course, but for me personally I don't get involved in what people talk about.  That's not -- I've been out of that department I told you guys for a long time now.  So mentally, me personally, I got to go home, start my treatment right now, get my mind focused and get my body focused and get my body ready for Game 4, and we take it one possession at a time.\nQ. Steve Kerr was saying after the game that he felt he kept telling his team, Kyrie and LeBron will get tired, they can't play one-on-one for 45 minutes.  Was fatigue in your mind a factor in the late game execution?\nLEBRON JAMES: No, only missed shots.  We missed shots.  I gave everything that I had, so at times throughout the game I was tired, but that's just because I was just playing as hard as I could.  But I was able to get second and third and fourth winds.  I don't contribute as losing this game because we got tired.  We missed some shots, and they made some.\nQ. Also, can you talk about your mindset when Kevin came up the court with about 40 seconds left to go and he paused at the three-point line when you were defending him?\nLEBRON JAMES: What do you mean my mindset?\nQ. What were you looking to do in that situation?  What were you thinking he was going to do?\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I seen him getting ready to pull up, he uses a rhythm dribble to get a good look, and when K.D. shoots, he falls forward, and I wanted to get a contest.  The last thing I want to do is foul a jump shooter.  So I wanted to jump and contest it, but I know he -- when he shoots, he kind of leans forward a little bit.  So I just stayed there, high hands, contested, and he made it.\nQ. Did you guys -- throughout that game, were you convinced you were going to win it, or did you feel like you were in control of it?\nLEBRON JAMES: Of course we thought we was going to win.  That's just -- we had an opportunity.  They had opportunities as well.  And they made the most of them, and we didn't.  So, yeah, we came in the game believing we was going to win for sure.\nQ. I'm saying as the game went on, when you looked around, the shots you were making, the way your guys were playing?\nLEBRON JAMES: We were playing good basketball.  Kyrie got it going, JR got it going as well, so we had some really good looks, like I said.  I can't go back and think of it right now exactly all the possessions that we had in the fourth quarter, but we had some good looks.\nQ. You had 39-11-9 and Kyrie had 38 and 6.  Does that constitute as your best shot?  Did the Warriors take your best shot tonight?\nLEBRON JAMES: I mean, it's so hard to say, but like I said, for me personally, I gave everything I had tonight.  So win, lose, or draw, you live with the results.  Like I said, they played a really good game as well, but they made shots, they made shot down the stretch.  They got stops, which they have been doing.  We shot in the low 40s again.  They got stops and then they made play after play down the stretch.\nQ. They withstand that from you guys tonight, Game 2 they turn it over 20 times and still win.  I mean, can you wrap your head around what kind of team you're dealing with here in the Warriors?\nLEBRON JAMES: Yeah, I mean, before the series even started we knew what we was dealing with.  I said it after we won the Eastern Conference Finals that we're getting ready for a juggernaut.  It's probably the most, most firepower I've played in my career.  I played against some great teams, but I don't think no team has had this type of firepower.\nSo even when you're playing well, you got to play like A plus plus, because they're going to make runs and they're going to make shots and they got guys that's going to make plays.  So we made enough plays tonight to still win the ball game, but they made a couple more.\nQ. Along those lines, LeBron, you have faced a lot of great teams in The Finals over the years.  When there's so little room for error against this team, how physically and emotionally draining is that on you?\nLEBRON JAMES: On me personally, I mean, obviously it's physically and emotionally draining because I give everything to the game and want to put myself and my teammates in a position to be successful.  So but I lay it all on the floor, and I did that tonight, gave everything that I had, both mentally and physically.  So obviously I'm drained right now, ready to get home.  But you're going against a team like this and you put together a game like we had where we had an opportunity, it's definitely draining.\nQ. Will you look back at the game and think if there is more minutes I do play, if there's more I can do?\nLEBRON JAMES: No.  No, I did, like I said, I gave everything that I had to this game, so I don't look at it saying I wish I could have did this or I would have did that.  I left it out on the floor.\n",
  "Q. Of course you guys are back home.  You played fantastically in the first two games, but you're down 2-0.  How frustrating it is for you to be here down 2-0, despite you playing so great?\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I wouldn't say frustrated.  Just you never want to be down 2-0 in a series against anybody.  So we had some things that we need to do better obviously from Game 1 and Game 2 to get Game 3 tomorrow, and we look forward to the challenge once again.\nWe know it's a tall challenge for us, but it's a great moment to be a part of, so we look forward to what tomorrow brings.\nQ. Do you think for you personally it would be better to play even better, if it's possible, because you're playing so good or inspire your teammates to elevate their games?\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, at the end of the day there's other things that I can do better and hope that I can do better to help this team be successful.  It is my leadership, and try to use my inspiration to help the guys as well.\nSo we all have a job to do, and we want to all try to do it even better than we can at times.  So if I can give a little bit more, then I will.  But I leave everything that I have out on the floor every night, so I'm always satisfied with the way I play.\nQ. You guys faced the exact same 2-0 deficit a year ago when you came back to Cleveland.  How, if at all, does this 2-0 deficit feel different than the one you faced a year ago?\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't know, I don't remember how I felt last year being down 2-0.  That's last year and I don't even know the feeling anymore.  So just mentally I'm just mentally strengthening my mind and getting my mind ready and focused on what tomorrow's going to bring, and so I look forward to it.\nQ. You've said that the biggest difference between the Warriors last year and this year is K.D.  You've told us that.  How does that change the dynamic of this series for a team that's coming home down 2-0?\nLEBRON JAMES: No, it doesn't change anything.  We got to protect home.  It starts with tomorrow.  One game at a time, one possession at a time, and cleaning up on some of the miscues that we have had in the first couple games and not have as many.\nQ. This is kind of similar to that, but this is two years in a row where you guys have trailed pretty much the entire series against this team.  Obviously you caught them at the end last year, but does it take a mental toll on you to constantly be playing from behind against this team in a seven-game series?\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't know.  It takes a mental toll just when you lose.  No matter if it's a series or game or whatever the case may be, in the post-season any loss always takes a mental toll on you.  But how can you refocus your mind, how can you refuel it to understand that at the end of the day it is a series.  So you got to try to focus on the next game and focus on your job and what you can do to help your team be successful going into the following game.\nQ. You've always said that throughout your career things never came easy, you always had to go the hard route, hard path.  With this situation right here that you're in, do you feel like this is not comfortable territory but territory that you're accustomed to?\nLEBRON JAMES: Yeah, it's something I am accustomed to.  It's something that I feel like is -- that it's okay for me to kind of always go back and know that I can refocus.  I can get my guys ready, get myself ready.  But you hate to continue to put yourself in these positions, but at the end of the day it's still just basketball, man, and that's what gives me comfortable and I'm more comfortable about it because it's just a game.  I prepare myself, I'm going to go out and do my job and live with the results.\nQ. I know you want to get guys involved and you need to get guys involved offensively.  Is that harder to do, though, at this point in the series when you're down 2-0 and you probably need to be more aggressive?\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't really know.  I never really understood that question as far as my game.  I play my game and I don't change it no matter what the series is, I don't change it what the course of the day is, I don't change it what the score is.  I just play my game.\nMy game is being aggressive.  My game is getting my guys involved.  My game is getting into the paint, shooting some outside shots when they're available.  But my game is -- it is what it is.  So it's not going to change because a series -- I'm down 2-0 or up 2-0.  It's going to be the same.\nQ. A lot of people say, though, the one thing you guys could do is slow the game down.  Is that easier said than done, and how do you do it against a team that runs like they do?\nLEBRON JAMES: That's not our game.  We don't play slowdown basketball.\nQ. That was my question, can you afford to play at this fast pace, because it seems to favor them?  If you don't believe that this series has been played at their pace so far, what -- well, do you feel the series has been played at their pace?\nLEBRON JAMES: We play at our pace.  We play our game.  We got to this point playing our way.  We have won a lot of games playing the way we play, so we're not going to change.\nQ. You said that it's just a game and it's basketball, right?  Can the rest of the guys playing in their home arena, can it -- can you kind of forget about the pageantry and the stage and just fall into playing a basketball game?  Is it easier to do at home?\nLEBRON JAMES: For myself, I can only speak for myself, I don't know what -- I mean, for me, like I said, no matter win, lose, or draw, if you give everything you got to the game and you prepare yourself mentally, physically, you do your job, then there's nothing to be afraid of the moment for, there's nothing to be disappointed or about the game or how the outcome is.  If you prepare yourself, then you can be okay with the outcome.  I mean I can.  I speak for myself.\nQ. It seems like the Warriors in the third quarter, the differential's been pretty big and the runs that they go on after you guys cut it to so close, they can just go up in the snap of a finger.  What's the best way you can just kind of not allow that to happen, I guess?\nLEBRON JAMES: Take great shots and not turn the ball over.  We had an opportunity, last game, we cut it to four, and then they made a couple plays here, I think.  If I remember, it was -- I think it was 86-82, they come out, I did a stupid strip foul on Livingston, he hits two free throws, we come down and turn the ball over, and then they hit a three and it went from a four-point game to a 10-point game that fast.  So just can't make bad plays against a team that's that great.\nQ. You also said that you want to get Kyrie Irving going early, kind of like how you guys did with Kevin for those first two games.  What's the best way you can do that for him?\nLEBRON JAMES: I think he does a great job of it as well, but it's just some of the sets that we call, and that's just -- you can say it, you can put him in position to be successful, and we just try to lay bodies on his guys that's guarding him, make -- if he's open, just get him the ball on time, on target, and let his talent take over from there.\nQ. There's been talk obviously here about pace, and there's been some chatter about maybe a change with Iman for JR.  How do you sort of balance the need to adapt to the situation versus trusting who you've been all year?\nLEBRON JAMES: Yeah, I mean, some of these questions are kind of out of my hands, as far as when you talk about lineup changes and what y'all should do offensively.  I'm one of the players on the team.  I'm a big piece of the team, I know that, but I'm not in control of who should be in inserted into the lineup, who shouldn't be.\nI think we have all trusted each other, we have all been in position where we trust each other out on the floor.  And whoever is on the floor has to do their job, and we trust that they will do their job.  So we look forward, like I said, to whatever our coaching staff has planned for us tomorrow night.\nQ. If there is one thing, one aspect that you can change for Game 3, Tyronn Lue said this would be defensively, what's your opinion?\nLEBRON JAMES: We just want to continue to play how we did in Game 2.  I thought we were much more physical, we had bodies on bodies and we have to do that against those guys, because if we let them run free, then they are even that more dangerous.\nSo like I said, if we do a good job of not turning the ball over and forcing turnovers like we did in Game 3, that will put us in a lot better position as well and just continue to get contesting their shots.  They do make a lot of contested shots, and some of those we can live with, but some of the ones that we can't live with or we don't have a hand in or we give them open looks or things of that nature or messing up on communication on some of our defensive sets, but if we -- we have a great game plan, and if can follow that for the full 48 minutes, then we give ourselves a great chance to win.\n",
  "Q. You talked about preparation.  Did you prepare differently for this NBA Finals than you prepare the rest of the regular season?\nLEBRON JAMES: No.  It's the same way I prepare for every game.  I don't take for granted the opportunity to play in this game.  So it's been the same.\nQ. How will playing with pace assist you in Game 2?\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, you can't play with pace when you turn the ball over.  That's one thing we did in Game 1 that we're going to be very conscious about going into Game 2, especially on their home floor.\nWe're a team that plays with pace.  We know that.  And in order for us to be as good as we can be offensively, we have to play with pace.  But we have to control the ball as well.\nQ. Have you done any simulations inside your mind on getting a good start on Game 2, or is it something that you go with the flow?\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't simulate anything in my mind.  I just think about the game plan.  I think about the matchups and things that we can do better.\nSo we have today, and we're going to prepare tomorrow as well.  Get ready for the game.  We'll be ready for the challenge.\nQ. How can you exploit those pick-and-roll situations that you guys did so amazingly in the last Finals?\nLEBRON JAMES: We have to be much better.  Game 1 was the feel-out for us, and they definitely took advantage of all our miscues.  We just have to get better.\nQ. Is getting more physical something that you need to do?\nLEBRON JAMES: That's always been something that we talk about, so we look forward to seeing what we can bring to the game in Game 2.\nQ. Coach Lue said this is the best team he's ever seen.  Do you agree with that?\nLEBRON JAMES: I've seen a lot of great teams, and they rank right up there.  They work well together.  They have some guys that can actually lead a franchise without anybody else by themselves.  They put you in tough positions defensively and offensively, so you have to be able just to keep your composure, stick to the game plan and try to execute as best as you can for sure.\nQ. Winning a road game in 30 straight in playoff series, what does it mean to be able to go on the road and have so much success?\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't know.  For me, I approach every game the same way, no matter if I'm at home or on the road.  But I understand the road is very challenging, especially when you get to this level -- you get to The Finals, you get to the Eastern Conference Finals.  It's very difficult to win on the road, and I've been fortunate to be able to do that in my career.\nQ. Is it weird the last time you didn't get one was (indiscernible)?\nLEBRON JAMES: No, it's not.  I don't even know about the stats of my career until someone brings it up.  So I don't get caught up in what I've done over the years.  I get drawn in too much of what I'm doing right now in the present, and my only focus is what I can to help this team be better for Game 2.\nQ. How do you get Korver more involved?\nLEBRON JAMES: It's going to be in the flow.  When it's least expected, he's going to knock down some shots.  He actually had some great looks in Game 1, two of them in the first half for sure where he had some wide-open ones and just wasn't able to connect.  One right before the halftime he had one at the top of the key, wasn't able to connect.\nSo we always like to get him involved.  He does a great job of spreading the floor for us.  And when he's going, the rest of our team does as well.\nQ. What does picking up the pace look like?  Does that fall on you and Kyrie?\nLEBRON JAMES: Pretty much.  It falls on the ball handlers -- myself, Kyrie, D-Will [Deron Williams], Shump -- that bring the ball up the floor.  But also it's guys just running wide.  We all have to just run out, create space, create opportunity early in the offense before the defense gets set, where they're really good at.\nQ. You always talked about the difference between aggressive turnovers and unforced turnovers.  When you look at the film from Game 1, did you see more of one or the other?\nLEBRON JAMES: We had a lot of unforced turnovers.  Some of them was aggression.  I had two charges -- that's aggression, I can take those.  But I also had some where I got caught up in the air, trying to make some skip passes, and they were able to pick them off.  Those are like pick-sixes.  It's like throwing the ball to Deion Sanders.  For the most part, it's going to be a touchdown going the other way.\nSo there's a fine line.  You'll have some of those tight turnovers where guys are getting into the lane and trying to make a play -- that's okay.  But once you get caught up in the air or you're just swinging the ball carelessly and they're picking those off, you can't have those.\nQ. What can Tristan Thompson do to be more effective on the floor?\nLEBRON JAMES: Be himself.\nQ. Golden State was so successful in Game 1 even though two of their top stars didn't get much going offensively.  Does that pass through your mind?\nLEBRON JAMES: No, no.  At the end of the day they have so many -- it's not about scoring.  If you know Draymond, first of all, scoring is the last thing in his mind.  He's going to always guard one of the best players on the opposing end.  He's going to get rebounds, he's going to get guys involved and he's going to use his basketball IQ.  Klay had some good looks and they just didn't go in.\nWe don't get involved in who didn't play well, who played what.  Their team played well, and that's all that matters.\nQ. You and Randy [Mims] and Mav [Maverick Carter] and Rich [Paul] have been together for so long.  Their impact over the last 10 years in terms of easing everything else and allowing you to concentrate on what you need to concentrate on.  How important has that been?\nLEBRON JAMES: It's been very important.  I think that not only as far as them being able to handle things off the floor so I can focus on basketball, the biggest thing Maverick, Raymond and Rich have given me is that if I'm messing up they're saying, what they hell are you doing.  You need to snap back, whatever you're doing, that's not how we do it.  When you have people around you like that who not just along for the ride and just always saying yes and saying you're doing well even though you're not, that shapes you.  That shaped me.  It shaped me to become who I am today.\nThey stay on me constantly.  If there's something they don't see to be in my right judgment, then they tell me.  When you have that open dialogue and that respect for each other as men, it definitely allows me to not only be a better basketball player but a better man, a better husband, a better friend, things of that nature, a better dad.  They've allowed me to be comfortable being me.\nQ. How important is it to have somebody thhat you don't have to put them through the BS detector?  You know it's real.\nLEBRON JAMES: Right.  Just the years we've been together.  I've known Maverick since I was 5, I've known Randy since I was 8 and I've known Rich since I was 14, 15.  We have been around this whole thing, we have seen it all and we kind of grew up together.  To know that they're not going to sugarcoat anything with me, no matter if I like it or not, it means everything.\nQ. How do you block out the noise and what do you say to your teammates who are trying to block out the noise with you, especially the guys that are here for the first time?\nLEBRON JAMES: I really don't hear the noise.  I couldn't really care less.  It really doesn't matter to me.  I'm just here to play ball and compete for a championship.  The narrative and people writing articles and things like that, I don't care.  Those things doesn't bother me.\nSo it's hard for me to even tell my teammates, hey, don't listen to it, because I don't even get involved in it.  I stopped caring a long time ago, so it doesn't even bother me at all.\nQ. Most of the guys on the team say that you control the music in the locker room before the game.  Is the playlist going to change now that you're down 0-1?\nLEBRON JAMES: No.  It's whatever I'm feeling.\nQ. (Indiscernible) rigorous work ethic.  As you get older, do you think you have to (indiscernible)?  Or is that something you'll continue to do?\nLEBRON JAMES: That's a great question.  I don't know.  My mental motor is still going, and my physical motor is trying to keep up with it.  It's like that's all I know.  It's like anybody that wakes up and the first thing they do is go get some coffee.  They can't do anything without drinking coffee.  Or the first thing they do is read the newspaper.  You know it's just who I am.  The first thing I do when I wake up is I go to the gym.  No matter if I'm at home or on the road, it's just part of my DNA.  I don't know if it will slow down.  Obviously I know I won't be able to play this game forever, but I do know I'll be able to work out for quite a while.  I think it's just a lifestyle for me.\nQ. What defensive adjustments does the team need to make?  Is it simply attitude? Or aggression?\nLEBRON JAMES: It's not that simple.  You need to be more aggressive, you need to have a better attitude --  if it were that easy, we would all do it.  It's not that simple, especially when you're going against such a well-oiled machine in Golden State.  So we will make adjustments and they will too.  That's what good teams do, and we look forward to see what happens tomorrow.\n",
  "Q. From your perspective, what went wrong in that third period?  The game was still within reach, and then they broke it open late in the third.\nLEBRON JAMES: And that's -- it wasn't just the third quarter, it was the whole game.  It started with myself having some turnovers, especially in the first half.  I pride myself on not turning the ball over, and I did it too much.\nSo 20 turnovers for 21 points on the road and 56 points in the paint, we did a great job of covering the 3-point line, but other than that, they played a hell of a game.\nQ. One follow-up with that, so much was made about the time off for both teams, any prospect of rust being a factor?\nLEBRON JAMES: No, I don't think so.  But I also know that you cannot simulate what they bring to the table.  No matter how many days that you have to prepare, you can't simulate what they have.  So it's great to get the first game up underneath us.  We made a lot of mistakes; they capitalized.  And we get an opportunity to get a couple days to see what they did and see what we did wrong and how we can be better in Game 2.\nQ. If there was one thing that stands out to you about them, whether it's speed or whatever, what would it -- what was it for tonight?\nLEBRON JAMES: K.D.\nQ. He just -- obviously he hasn't been here in the last two Finals.  I mean, what is it about him?  What kind of impact does he make?  How does he change things?\nLEBRON JAMES: I mean, you take one of the best teams that we had ever assembled last year, that we saw in the regular season and in the post-season, and then in the off-season you add a high-powered offensive talent like that and a great basketball IQ like that, that's what stands out.\nI mean, it's no if, ands, or buts.  It is what it is.  We got to figure out how to combat that, which is going to be a tough challenge for us.  But that's what stands out.\nQ. Doc Rivers said that the Warriors have this penchant for making teams almost concentrate too much on the three.  You start to get it in your head that you need to prevent them from 3-pointers, and then the inside opens up.  Were you guys victims of that tonight, did you feel that?\nLEBRON JAMES: No, we was victims of ourself, for one.  Like I said, we had 20 turnovers, and there's no way you're going to win a ball game having 20 turnovers against this team and on the road.  But at the end of the day, we gave up a lot in transition.  They had 27 points on fast breaks.\nQ. Follow-up, Kyrie and you got into a lot of isolation situations.  Do you feel like the ball needs to move a little more?\nLEBRON JAMES: That's part of our game.  That's part of our game.  It's what got us here.  So we definitely want to be more in the 20s in assists, but that's what got us here.  And we got to be able to make shots.  We got to be able to move the ball.  We know that.  But playing iso ball has helped us get to this point, and it has gave us success in the last three years.  So we don't want to have a high steady diet of it because the defense becomes stagnant and our players become stagnant, but that's part of our package.\nQ. When your offense isn't flowing the way that you're used to and you're turning the ball over the way that you were tonight, what can be done, if anything, to not allow that to carry over to the defensive end?\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I think that -- I mean, a couple instances.  First of all, we got to stop the ball in transition.  There was a few times where we fanned out to the 3-point line and let guys just go right down the middle for a dunk.  And I know, I believe, K.D. had two or three of those.  So when you turn the ball over, you got to know that that's their best.  That's when they become very dangerous because those guys, they sprint down the lane, they sprint to the 3-point line, they put a lot of pressure on your defense.\nBut the ball is the number one thing.  We got to stop the ball first and then fan out to the 3-point line if those guys go there.\nQ. Were you surprised how many times the Warriors drove in and got to the rim tonight?\nLEBRON JAMES: No, I wasn't surprised at anything.  They are a high-powered offensive team.  They can shoot the ball from the perimeter, they can get into the paint.  They do everything exceptionally well, if not great.  So never surprised by anything that they can do.\nQ. As a leader, what is your message to your teammates after a bad lost like this?\nLEBRON JAMES: Just get focused on Game 2.  We made a lot of mistakes.  There's nothing really needs to be said.  We know we're capable of playing a lot better.  We didn't play as well as we know we're capable of, so we look forward to the next one.\nQ. Tristan seemed to have a tough night.  A bunch of guys had a tough night.  Outside of you, Kyrie, and Kevin, what do you need from the complementary players in this series?  What do you need out of them?\nLEBRON JAMES: Just to be themselves and do what they have done throughout the course of the season, throughout the course of the last couple years.  Play with energy, play with effort, play with their mind and their bodies and understand what we're trying to accomplish.\nSo it's going to be -- this is The Finals, and we don't care about making mistakes, just play as hard as you can and follow the game plan, have your mind in it.  And if your mind is fresh and your mind is into it, then a lot of things take care of itself.\nQ. First quarter you had eight free throws, you had four the rest of the game.  Do you feel like you could have been doing more driving to the hole?  It's one of your strengths, obviously.\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, the game is -- I mean, it's played how it's played.  I don't know.  I mean, first half I had six turnovers, second half I had two.  So could I have turned the ball over more in the second half?  I mean, the game is just -- the game is just played that way.\nMODERATOR: Thank you, LeBron.\n",
  "Q. You've always been outspoken about social issues, and it seems that you're kind of in the middle of one.  The incident at your home in Los Angeles, do you have any comments on that?\nLEBRON JAMES: I mean, as I sit here on the eve of one of the greatest sporting events that we have in sports, race and what's going on comes again and on my behalf and my family's behalf.  But I look at it as this.  I mean, if this -- if this is to shed a light and continue to keep the conversation going on my behalf, then I'm okay with it.  My family is safe.  At the end of the day, they're safe, and that's the most important.\nBut it just goes to show that racism will always be a part of the world, a part of America.  And, you know, hate in America, especially for African Americans, is living every day.  And even though that it's concealed most of the time, even though people hide their faces and will say things about you and when they see you they smile in your face, it's a life every single day.\nAnd I think back to Emmett Till's mom, actually.  It's kind of one of the first things I thought of, and the reason that she had an open casket is because she wanted to show the world what her son went through as far as a hate crime and being black in America.\nSo it's like it doesn't -- no matter how much money you have, no matter how famous you are, no matter how many people admire you, being black in America is -- it's tough.  And we got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as African Americans, until we feel equal in America.  But my family is safe, and that's what's -- that's what's important.\nQ. That's such a strong statement from you and now we turn it to basketball, when you're talking about real-life issues.  How do you move on to that, looking ahead to tomorrow night and knowing that this took place?\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, at the end of the day, I'll be focused tomorrow on our game plan and focused on these games.  But I also know, I mean, I'm at a point in my life where my priorities is in place and basketball comes second to my family.  It actually comes after me continuing to be a role model to the youth and what I do as far as with my foundation.  It won't take no -- I will be as focused as I can be on the job at hand tomorrow, but it always -- this is a situation where it just puts me back in place of what's actually more important, and basketball's not the most important thing in my life.\nQ. At this point, LeBron, going to so many Finals, I'm sure you've heard almost every type of question, answered every type of question.  Do you mind telling us a story or an experience from your Finals experience that maybe we haven't heard before?\nLEBRON JAMES: I can't even sit here and to even think about it -- I'm just -- I'm in a position where I'm just blessed and I'm honored to be a part of -- we have All-Star Weekend and we have The Finals.  These are our two biggest events.  The NBA Draft would be third.  And I'm sitting here, once again, with this franchise and being able to be a part of the NBA Finals where our game is covered by so many different countries all over the world and it brings the spotlight to two of the best teams that we have in our sport today.  So that's what I'm more proud about, and that's the story I have right now.\nQ. What's your relationship with Kevin Durant like?  I know you spent time in the off-season, you've played on national teams.  And like I know in 2011, didn't he come out to Akron to come train with you a little bit?  Do you have that relationship still, or is it a healthy, competitive --\nLEBRON JAMES: Our relationship is very good.  Our relationship consists of if someone needed something, we can always reach out to one another.  And if not, then it doesn't take away from it.  We have always had a mutual respect of one another, being competitors.  I've always wanted to -- because I was in the NBA before him and when he came in, I watched him and things of that nature, even before he came in I always gave him just an if you need anything to bounce of or someone to bounce something off, you can always use me because I had experience being drafted to a franchise that now they're expecting you to be the franchise player.\nSo with him going to Seattle, he always could use me and things of that nature.  And so all over the course of the years throughout his -- throughout his journey, I've always had an open-door policy and with K.D., and so I guess that's pretty much it.\nQ. One more question about the incident.  How do you explain something like that to your own children?\nLEBRON JAMES: Oh, I think the most unfortunate part is that I'm here right now and I can't be home to see my boys right now.  My little girl's too young to actually understand it right now.  But I can't sit in front of my boys right now and I won't be home until next week, so this is kind of killing me inside right now, but my wife is unbelievable.  My mother, my mother-in-law, my sister-in-law, they're going to do a great job of talking to them when they get home from school today.  Because of Apple being so great, I can FaceTime them and -- but I like to do face-to-face conversations when it becomes with a situation like this.\nBut that's the -- I talked about this before, having two sons, two sons that's very -- they have great minds, they're very open to life and love life and things of that nature, so for me to be able just to try to give them the blueprint as much as I can on what life has to offer, but at the end of the day they're going to have to walk their own path, and hopefully I give them enough life skills throughout their journey where when they're ready to fly, they can fly on their own.\nQ. You've been through multiple highs throughout your career, last year, sounds like this is it again, do you still get a drive or a high of trying to -- I don't want to say prove people wrong, but just try to silence folks?\nLEBRON JAMES: No, I'm not in that department anymore.  I left that in the 20s.  I'm not in the \"prove people wrong, silence critics\" people department no more.  I got a promotion when I got to the 30s.  So at the end of the day, I mean, I know what I've done and I know what I'm built -- I know the way I'm built, my only motivation is to be able to compete for a championship every single year.  And I'm sitting here today blessed once again because I put in the work and our teammates have put in the work.  So, yeah, that doesn't matter to me.\nQ. I wanted to know if the incident stirred any emotions inside of you and how you manage them, if it does.\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I have a -- I mean, obviously you see I'm not my normal energetic self.  It will pass.  That's fine.  I'm figuring it out.  I'm thinking about my kids a lot.  Obviously I'm not in front of them, so but my wife -- I talked to my wife and she was pretty -- she's -- she's the Energizer Bunny of the family, and she said everything's fine.  So that helps me out a lot.\nBut time heals all.  And at the end of the day, like I said, if this incident that happened to me and my family today can keep the conversation going and can shed light on us trying to figure out a way to keep progressing and not regressing, then I'm not against it happening to us again.  I mean it's as long as my family is safe.\nQ. You do seem very aware, though, of your historical perspective in the game, seven straight Finals with two different teams and now part of this trilogy.  Do you see each step of this, and this one in particular, as another brick in building your own personal legacy in the game?\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I think that I never really talk about my legacy.  I kind of just live in the moment and if I'm able to accomplish something, then it kind of adds to it on its own.  So in this instance, seeing some of the stats and some of the history and things of that nature, and I'm the first person to go to the Finals seven straight times since I think Bill Russell and those guys back in the '50s, I believe, or '60s, and I was the first guy to take a franchise -- two different franchise to the Finals four times.  So at the end of the day I want to be able to once I hang it up and not play this game anymore, that people can look at what I was able to accomplish, win, lose or draw, and say that he made a difference.  So that's what I'm here for.\nQ. If I could follow-up, how deeply satisfying was it to you especially after the circumstances under which you left Cleveland to then return last year and deliver that title?\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, it was a goal of mine.  Satisfying is -- I'm not a, I don't like to be satisfied too much.  Because then you become complacent.  But it was a reward because when you set out a goal and you're able to achieve that reward or achieve that goal, like all of us, then it's rewarding and you feel good about it.\nBut I'm not a complacent person.  After we was able to accomplish that last year and we celebrated for a few days, I got right back to work, mentally and physically get my body ready because I wanted to be able to put myself and put our teammates and put our franchise in position where we had an opportunity to do it again.\nMODERATOR: Thank you, LeBron.\n",
  "Q. LeBron, first off, congratulations on the win.  So this being your third title, there's obviously a lot of footnotes that separate this, but does this championship resonate with you as being a little bit extra special being that it's for the city of Cleveland, for the state of Ohio where you grew up?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Absolutely.  Just knowing what our city has been through, northeast Ohio has been through, as far as our sports and everything for the last 50-plus years.  You could look back to the Earnest Byner fumble, Elway going 99 yards, to Jose Mesa not being able to close out in the bottom of the ninth to the Cavs went to The Finals -- I was on that team -- in 2007, us getting swept, and then last year us losing 4-2.  And so many more stories.\r\nAnd our fans, they ride or die, no matter what's been going on, no matter the Browns, the Indians, the Cavs and so on, and all other sports teams.  They continue to support us.  And for us to be able to end this, end this drought, our fans deserve it.  They deserve it.  And it was for them.\nQ. I asked you a couple times about that, about the notion of what finally winning one would do for yourself and for the city of Cleveland, and also especially for Akron.  I just wonder, now that you've accomplished it, is it relief?  Is it excitement?  What are the emotions?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I mean, yeah, David, you've been harping on it a lot the last couple weeks.  But for me, I'm true to the game, and I know what I bring to the table.  I came back for a reason.  I came back to bring a championship to our city.  I knew what I was capable of doing.  I knew what I learned in the last couple years that I was gone, and I knew if I had to -- when I came back, I knew I had the right ingredients and the right blueprint to help this franchise get back to a place that we've never been.  That's what it was all about.\r\nRight now it's just excitement.  It's not even relief.  It's just excitement for us as a team, as a franchise, as a city, as a community.  To be able to continue to build up our city, to continue to be an inspiration to our city, it means everything.  I'm happy to be a part of it.\nQ. At 3-1 with them having two on their record at home, what do you think turned the series around?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: For me, when I came up here after we lost Game 4 at home, I said, hey, listen, we've got to take one possession, one game at a time.  We're going to Golden State, so we've got to fly home anyways, so why not have another game?\r\nAnd I believed in that.  And my guys believe in me as their leader every single day.  I preach to them every single day.  I'm their leader, and they allow me to lead those guys every single night.  I was just true to that.  I believed, and nobody else believed besides the other 14 guys and our coaching staff and our fans.  So it's just going out and executing and putting things together and making plays, and we were able to do that.\nQ. LeBron, when you're sitting on the bench before the game and the National Anthem, you seemed to be deep in thought.  What was really going through your mind at that point?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Just zeroing in on what needs to be done to help us win.  Obviously I put the effort into it, but just thinking about the game, thinking about the plays, understanding that they're going to make a run.  They're a great team.  Understanding that we're going to make some mistakes, but it's how we come back from it and how we move on to the next possession.\r\nThen also just living in the moment.  I told my guys before the game:  Listen, there is a game to be played, but there's not many guys, there's not many teams that get an opportunity to be in the NBA Finals in a Game 7.  There's just not.\r\nAnd this is my second one, and I'm able to say that I've been victorious twice in Game 7.\r\nI just told the guys:  Don't take this for granted.  Don't take it for granted.  Let's go out.  Our coaching staff gave us a great plan; let's go execute it.\nQ. You guys are losing tears there, J.R. Smith, it's a real genuine scene.  What comes to your mind, all the people that were for you when you were young?  What is happening?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: A little bit of everything.  I think all the emotions, everything.  Obviously I know what J.R.'s been through in his career.  People counting him out and saying he's this, he's that, not understanding -- you can't have that.  That's not yours.  That's for Daddy.\r\nJust understand what J.R.'s been through and people just saying that there's no way he can be a winner.  When our GM came to us last year and said, hey, we've got a deal to get Timofey Mozgov and get Iman Shumpert, and the Knicks are going to throw in J.R., I was like, what?  They're going to throw in J.R. into the deal?  And I was like, okay, I've got him.  I got him.\r\nAnd J.R. turned himself into not only a huge boost to our team, but he turned himself into a two-way player, both sides of the floor.  And I think those emotions came out of J.R. at the end of those games.  Those emotions came out of me, just leading 14 guys and understanding, like I said, what our city's been through over the last 50-plus years since Jim Brown.  Then also people just counting me out.  Throughout my 13-year career, I've done nothing but be true to the game, give everything I've got to the game, put my heart, my blood, sweat, tears into the game, and people still want to doubt what I'm capable of doing.\r\nSo that was a little icing on the cake for myself to just let me know that everything I've done, it results in this.  They say hard work pays off, and that's what happened tonight.\nQ. LeBron, what is it about the athlete's mind or your mind that you don't feel that 3-1 is insurmountable especially against this team and you've got to win two here?  Then the last three games, the fire that you maybe played -- or were you fueled by anything that happened between you and Draymond, in Klay's words, to give you extra fire in these three games?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I mean, at the end of the day you're down 3-1, and we've got to come here.  We've got to come here and win.  We had to win in this building anyways.  I mean, we only get three games at home.  So even if we sweep the home series in a seven-game series, we've got to win here anyway.\r\nSo Game 5 was a great opportunity for us to try to seize that, and we came up with a great game plan.  Our coaching staff gave us a great game plan, and we were able to send the game back home down 3-2.\r\nAnd we know our fans.  Our fans give us everything, and we were able to give it back to them.  Once we get to a Game 7, I'll take my chances versus anybody, versus any team.  You give me one game, you give me 48 minutes, I'll take my chances.  Once we got to a Game 7, I was just confident.  I knew what I was capable of doing.  I knew my guys would allow me to lead them throughout the 48 minutes, and they did that.\nQ. Your story is a bit like a Greek drama.  You come to the Cavaliers a home-grown product, you leave, you come back saying that you want to win for the city.  Can you talk about what you want to tell the Cleveland fans, the ones that got mad at you, the ones who never got mad at you?  And also right now you're an emotional person.  What is going through your heart and mind right now?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: What's going through my mind is I'm ready to get back to Cleveland.  I can't wait to get off that plane and hold that trophy up and see all our fans at the terminal, IX Jet Center, and I know they're going to be ready.  So I can't wait to give the emotion back to them.  I'm looking forward to it.  That's all.\nQ. What message do you have for fans there right now who are watching who are very happy?  And, again, the ones who were upset with you, the ones who were never upset with you?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: That don't matter.  That's yesterday's newspaper.  I don't think anybody's reading yesterday's newspaper.  They'll be reading tomorrow that I'm coming home.  I'm coming home with what I said I was going to do.\nQ. Can you even fathom what that parade's going to be like on Wednesday?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Oh, my goodness.  It's going to be probably one of the biggest parties -- I'm sorry, one of?  It's going to be the biggest party that Cleveland has ever seen ever.  So if you guys still have a little money left over in your budget, you guys better make a trip to Cleveland and get a little piece of it.\nQ. I spoke to the people around the team leading up to Game 7, and several people told me there is just a sense of calm emanating from you.  What put you in that mind space?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't know.  I don't know.  I can sit up here and say -- I don't know if it was \"The Godfather,\" I don't know if it was \"Couples Retreat\" that I watched, I don't know if it was \"Ocean's 11, 12, and 13,\" I don't know if it was the \"Revenge of the Nerds\" that I watched.  I really don't know.\r\nBut I was just so like, listen, you've put everything into the game.  The game always gives back to people that's true to the game.  I've watched it.  I know the history of the game, and I was just calm.  I was calm.  I was focused.  I was locked in.\r\nI don't know.  I wish I could tell you exactly what happened, but I had to be calm in order for my 14 guys to allow me to lead them and for those guys to play the way they played.\r\nI mean, I can't do it by myself, so that was my mindset.  I was confident.  I was calm.  You've got to stay low.  Like Jay-Z said, you've got to stay low and keep firing, and that's exactly what I did.\nQ. Finally, you told me when we were walking out in Toronto that if you got four more wins you'd share the secret motivation you alluded to last year?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I tell you one-on-one.  I tell you one-on-one (smiling).\nQ. That's fine.\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I'll tell you one-on-one.  I'll tell you one-on-one.  I'm out.\n",
  "Q. LeBron, you've been in plenty of Game 7s before, but only one in The Finals.  What do you recall from that Game 7 against the Spurs and is a Game 7 of The Finals any different than a Game 7 in another series?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I mean, I approach -- every postseason game is very key.  You don't put too much more added pressure on it because it's a Game 7.  One thing we all know is it's the last game of the season, so it's not like you're preserving any energy, be out there saying, okay, I've got to keep my body ready for the next game.  There's no next game.\r\nSo look forward to the challenge.  I mean, it's a Game 7, but I don't put too much more added pressure on it.\nQ. Is there anything you remember about that Spurs game besides winning?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Yeah, I remember pretty much everything about the game.  It was a tough game versus a great opponent.  Throughout the whole game we just had -- each possession was key.  Each possession was key.  There were momentum swings back and forth, but we were able to make a couple plays down the stretch to allow us to win that game.\nQ. We all know you're a team-first guy, but seeing this is Game 7, do you see it as this will be the game that will define your legacy of your career?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: No.\nQ. You don't see it that way?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: No.\nQ. Okay.  How much of a motivation for you is it to think about the opportunity to finally deliver a title to the people in Cleveland?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: For me, I'm going to give everything I've got to my teammates and my coaching staff tomorrow night, as I've always done.  And I live with the results.  One thing I can't live with is if I don't go out and give everything I had to the game and not be true to the game, that would stop me from sleeping.  So I'm ready to go.\nQ. LeBron, that Game 7 you played against San Antonio was I think a Thursday.  The fact that this is a Sunday, winner-take-all, for all the marbles type deal, is this like your Super Bowl Sunday that you grew up as a football guy?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Yeah, I mean, it is.  I think it is for the whole world that loves the game of basketball, that's had a close eye throughout the whole postseason and throughout The Finals.  It's also Father's Day as well.  I think that's very important to all the fathers out there in the world to get an opportunity to not only be with their loved ones and kids and things of that nature, but also to be able to watch the game.\r\nSo, I mean, it's pretty cool.  Like you said, to put it into Super Bowl Sunday, it's like one game.  It's one game, and you look forward to it.  I'm happy I'm able to be blessed just to be a part of it.\nQ. Quick follow-up, this could be one of the more viewed games or most viewed games in league history.  Over the course of your career, have you seen the sport of basketball and its popularity grow?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Oh, absolutely.  First of all, you give a lot of credit to all the guys that have laid the path, and then David Stern also had a vision and he's given it all to Adam Silver who has also put that vision.  Also he had his visions to continue to help grow our game.  I'm happy to say that I had a some part in the history of the game to say, hey, look, I was there when this happened or the game went to a couple more countries.  Once social media started, it continued to build our game up more.  I was a part of that timetable.\r\nSo it's an honor to be a part of a sport and be part of a beautiful game that you know that not only here in America but people all over the world can watch and be proud about it.\nQ. When you say you can live with the results, have you always been able to live with the results, and what got you to that point where you can?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I think it doesn't mean I don't -- I still go back on some of the losses I've had in my career, not only in just The Finals, but even in the postseason, period.\r\nWhen I said that, it's like, okay, did you give everything that you had?  Did you prepare yourself the best way you could have?  Did you leave it all on the floor?  And if you can tell yourself and look in the mirror and say yes, then sometimes there are some things you can't control.  You can control what you can control.  And the uncontrollable, you can't allow that to play with you that much.\r\nIt's not always been that way for me, but I think it's just from my growth, I've matured over the years and I know what's real and what's not real.\nQ. I know you've consistently said that if you do everything you can, you can live with what happens.  I just want to push a little bit back on that.  Given where you come from, where you've been, the whole arc of your career, you've never played in a game where if you win that game, Cleveland wins a championship.  And I wonder what you think about and what goes through your mind when you've contemplated what winning a championship would mean to Cleveland and Akron?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't think it's went through my mind until you asked me.  I don't put that type of thought on the game.  I came back for a reason, and that is to bring a championship to the city of Cleveland, to northeast Ohio and all of Ohio and all Cavaliers fans in the world.  That's been one of my goals.  But I don't add too much pressure on it.  I go out and trust what I've been able to do, the work I've put into it, my teammates have put into it.  And you go out there and see what happens.\nQ. You said you don't put that pressure on yourself, but do you think of that in terms of pressure, or do you think of that in terms of opportunity, I guess would be the word?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, you say pressure because everyone -- that's like the whole world, the word everyone likes to use in sports is \"pressure.\"  I don't really get involved in it.  But I guess in layman's terms, pressure, I think it's an opportunity to do something special, and I'm fortunate to be in a position where I can be a part of something that was very special.\nQ. Following right up with that, you have made it clear that you don't want to make this just about ending the Cleveland drought.  But do you recognize that you are on the brink of finishing the storybook ending that I guess almost everyone imagined when you came back?  I mean, you're right there.\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't think people imagined it this way, the route that we've taken (laughing), and that's fine.  Like I always say, every day is not a bed of roses and you have to be able to figure out how to get away from the thorns and the pricklers of the rose and things of that nature to make the sunshine.  So we've put ourselves in a position to do something special.\r\nYou guys ask me the questions, but you guys know the answers to them.  I mean, if we win and we take care of business, that's something that our city hasn't had in a very long time.  So that's the obvious.  You don't need me to sit up here and talk about it.\nQ. There's been talk about you being MVP, win or lose, of The Finals.  What are your thoughts on that?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Oh, listen, at the end of the day, I go out every single night and give everything I've got to the game.  The game has always given back to me.  So I'm okay with whatever.\nQ. Do you feel like it should tend to go to the winning -- or always go to the winning team, or just whoever was the best player?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't know how they -- last time I answered the question about MVP, it didn't go that well for me, so I'm not going to do it (laughing).  Yeah, I'm not going to do it.  I'm not going to do it again.  I'm not.  I will not.  Thanks, Chris, I will not do that again (laughing).\nQ. First couple games here you put up good numbers, but you weren't nearly as efficient personally as you have been the last few games.  What changed for you during the course of this series?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I would like to say I grow as the series goes on.  I'm fortunate enough, first of all, to help the series go on.  And I start to learn from my mistakes and break into the film and seeing the ways that they're defending me, the ways they're defending our team, ways I can be a little more efficient.  I've gotten better as the series has gone on.  I told you guys that me turning the ball over was something I'm not happy with, and I've got to figure out a way to not turn the ball over as much.  And I've been able to do that the last couple games and put myself and my team in a position to be successful.\r\nSo just digging in a little bit more and more into the film and also just being a little bit more conscious about how I can be successful for our team.\nQ. I'm just wondering, Ben Simmons has joined the Klutch family and he's been spending a lot of time in Cleveland.  What's your opinion of him?  The draft is next week.  Do you think the 76ers would be crazy to not pick him first?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I think he's a great young talent.  I think the way he displays on the basketball court, we all notice.  I think we all don't know just yet how great of a kid he is and how down to earth he is with the game of basketball and life in general.\r\nI had an opportunity to spend a lot of time over the last couple years with him and his family.  They're just so very appreciative of the opportunity that they've been given as a family.  Also, they give everything to their son.  They want the best for him.\r\nAnd as a mentor to him and big brother to him, I also give him a lot of advice on what to expect when he makes his jump next week, how to handle it.  But he also has to figure it out on his own as well because everybody's path is different.  I'm not a GM.  I don't get paid by the Sixers, so I'm not going to answer that.\nQ. What do you see sealing it?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I think he has all the tools, so it's up to him.\nQ. This isn't like a big focus on this part of your game, but you had nine blocked shots in the last three games.  Do you feel as locked in defensively as you did offensively?  How big have those shot blocks been and how much do you love doing it?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Defense has always been something of my game, it's something I pride more than the offensive end.  I've been highly upset that I've never won Defensive Player of the Year.  It was a goal of mine.  It's still a goal of mine, so we'll see what happens with that the rest of my career.\r\nBut I've always taken that side of the floor very seriously, and being able to guard multiple positions, being able to know what teams are doing out on the floor and putting my teammates in position to be successful, you know, that's always been something I've taken pride in.  Every now and then I'll protect the rim a little bit (laughing).  So I've been successful with that the last couple games.\r\nBut my teammates do a great job of putting me in position to be able to get some shot blocks.  Me also just not giving up on plays when sometimes guys have those full court lay-ups and have an opportunity to score.\nQ. LeBron, going back there was a stretch there of eight or ten games against Golden State that your shooting percentages were down around the 40% range.  The last four-odd games of this series, certainly the last two, they've really taken a jump up.  Is it you just sort of saying I'm going to shoot those mid-range shots that they're trying to give you?  What have you adjusted in terms of shooting in particular to take advantage?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I can't tell you exactly what I've adjusted to.  I would feel like you are a part of the Warriors at that point.  I'm just playing my game.  I'm watching a lot of film.  I'm seeing ways I can be successful out on the floor and I'm just trusting it.\nQ. I've heard you say many times that you are in the moment or the importance of being in the moment.  Is there ever a time where being in the moment is more important than in a winner-take-all game to define your season?  And how did you learn how to actually succeed at being in the moment?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I haven't always been successful being in the moment.  Some things you just can't control, like I said.  You can do everything you can.  You can study.  You can prepare.  You can go out and play as great as you've played before and you still can come out on the short end of the stick.\r\nIt happened to me before against Boston.  Me and Paul Pierce had a duel where I believe he had 50, I believe, and I had high 40s, gave everything I had, and we lost.  So that doesn't mean I wasn't in the moment.  That meant I was there.  I was mentally sharp.  I was in tune with the game plan.  Just sometimes you're not successful.\r\nBut for an opportunity for tomorrow, I mean, anybody that's ever played the game of basketball or done anything at any level, to be able to have an opportunity to have one game for it all?  I mean, you take it.\r\nIt's an opportunity, and it's going to be fun.\nQ. It seems like this series hasn't worked out for Kevin Love matchup-wise, and you guys have played along fine.  But for him in this series, I know it's not important to make sure he gets him going, it's not the regular season, but in what ways can he contribute and be effective while playing in the lineup?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: At the end of the day, if we win, it doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  We take care of business tomorrow and we put ourselves in position to win.  If we come out victorious, I don't think there's going to be guys talking about over the summer how bad or Kevin wasn't -- he didn't play well.  He had three fouls in the first half in Game 6.  You remember Kevin picked up that third foul that wasn't a foul?  I don't think anybody's going to say that.  They're going to say Kevin Love is a champion.  That's all that matters.\r\nSo no added pressure to Kevin.  No added pressure to our team.  We've got to go out and do our job.  Coach Lue is going to give us a game plan, we have to go out and execute it.  I'm the leader of the team, and I have to make sure my guys are ready.\r\nBut Kevin's name will be in the record books forever if we go out and take care of business tomorrow.  Doesn't matter what he shot, doesn't matter how many minutes he played, doesn't matter how many rebounds that you all thought he should have got, how many shots he should have been, how aggressive you all thought he should have been.  He'll be sitting home with a ring.  So that's all that matters.\n",
  "Q. LeBron, the last two games your efficiency rating is off the charts, and that's something that you pride yourself on.  What's been the key to being so efficient and having back-to-back 41-point games?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: I give a lot of credit to my teammates and my coaching staff to put me in position to be successful.  I mean, without the ball moving, without the screens being set, without the coaching staff putting out the game plans for us offensively then, what I've been able to do, it doesn't happen.  So those guys definitely get the credit.\nQ. And for Kyrie, you seemed to tweak your ankle or your foot.  Normally you'd wait around with the guys and leave, yet you headed straight to the locker room.  Can you give us an update?\r\nKYRIE IRVING: I'm good.  I'm good, yeah, I'm good.  I'm okay.\nQ. LeBron, with the turnovers that you had talked about early earlier in the series, you only had two in the last game, only one this game.  Talk about efficiency.  Do you think that's helped with the back-to-back 41-point games?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, I mean, we know we can't turn the ball over versus this team.  They make you pay anytime you make a mistake, and for us to only have 12 turnovers today for 16 points is definitely key to our success.\r\nYou can't turn the ball over versus anyone in our league, but especially in The Finals versus the defending champions.  You can't do it because they'll make you pay.  So we did a great job of not turning the ball over, including myself, and I just try to put myself in position, put my teammates in position to be successful.\nQ. LeBron, when you guys are down 3-1, to these guys that are on the left and right of you, what did you see in them or what do you see in them as a player and a person that gave you so much belief that you guys can put yourselves in position to do what you're doing right now?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, I mean, we just focus on the next game, focus on the next minute, and we focus on the game plan that we had to master up to try to even get to the next play.  And it wasn't even trying to get to a Game 7.  We were like, okay, well, once we went to Game 5, we went out there and being down 3-1, we were like, okay, well, we've got to go home anyway, so let's go home and play in front of our fans, and we were able to do that.\r\nAnd tonight, these guys were, I mean, unbelievable.  Once again, Double T's energy and activity, his level, his rebounding, obviously giving us extra possessions, but his defensive rebounding from the beginning was at an all-time high level for himself, even though as great as he is, he was spectacular tonight.  And Kyrie's just a floor general.  He does what he does.  It's no surprise what he does.  And we put ourselves in position to be able to be in a Game 7.\nQ. You've had obviously you've been in Game 7 in The Finals once before, on your home floor then, of course.  But home, road, one chance to win this championship, will the locale matter to you whatsoever?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: I'll take it.  It don't matter to me (laughing).  Like I told you guys the other day, it's two of the greatest words in the world, and that's \"Game 7\", so I'll play it anywhere.\nQ. How long did it take for the realization to set in that you have an ultimate game opportunity?  Were you even thinking about it before the clock hit zeros?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: No, I'm actually not really thinking about it too much right now.  I'm ready to start my treatment session, get home, getting something to eat, lay down, get ready for the flight tomorrow.  I'm very just chill right now, actually.\nQ. Kyrie, curious just about now that you are in Game 7, how you keep the moment from becoming too big?  I mean, this is the biggest game you've ever been in and after all that you've been through personally, how do you separate from that and just kind of focus on what you need to do out there on the floor?\r\nKYRIE IRVING: By just accepting it, don't shy away from it.  It's Game 7.  All I've done over my life is watched a lot of Game 7s and seen how guys come out, seeing the sway of the game, just watch a lot of film on it.  But now that I actually get to play in one and experience it, it's just I'm ready to live in it, and just hoping we come out with a win on the other end of it.\r\nBut this is the all-time, all-time high of being part of a team when both teams have one chance to win championships, one game that's separating that, and it just doesn't stop there.  So I'm excited to just get to Sunday and see what it's really like.\nQ. Tristan, what do you think allowed you to be so successful tonight?  What was your mindset coming into the game?\r\nTRISTAN THOMPSON: Like LeBron and Kyrie said, be a star in your role.  Be a star in your role, and for me that's high energy, use my motor, just play hard.  Play hard be relentless on the glass.  And that's what I bring to this team.  That's my job, just be a star in your role, and I try to do that every night.\nQ. Did you feel that you had kind of a connection with LeBron?  He was throwing the alley-oops, and it seemed like it was kind of just easy at one point.  Was there something that you saw on the defense that kind of allowed that play to continue over and over again?\r\nTRISTAN THOMPSON: He's a great passer.  Threw it right where I wanted it to go, and it's up to me to go up and go get it, go up and go get it.  When LeBron drives to the rim or Kyrie, they attract two guys, so for myself and others, just get to the open area and when they throw it to you, pass to you, go up and finish strong.\nQ. LeBron, in the second half there was a stretch where you scored or assisted on 27 straight points.  I think you scored 20 of them.  When you get in that mode, do you find something in terms of rhythm within yourself, or is it you finding something the way they're defending you?  Can you just describe what it's like to be like that and playing like that?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: I'm just out there playing, just reading, reacting.  My teammates, like I said, have put me in position to be successful either when I have the ball or don't have the ball, they give me the ball wherever I would like it.  Setting great screens and trying to put pressure on their defense.  I've been fortunate enough to see the ball go through the hoop the last couple of games.  So, you know, I feel pretty good.\nQ. You've obviously had a long history here in Cleveland.  What would it mean to you to be in the building tonight and see the fans have a game like this?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: They deserved it.  They deserved it.  We knew what we were going to get out of them, and now it was up to us to go out and give it back to them, and I think we held up our end of the bargain.  We knew what we were going to get out of those guys, all 20,000-plus.  They were phenomenal from the time we ran out on the floor.  So they deserved tonight, and it was special to be out there for them.\nQ. Do you allow yourself to feel that, the emotion of it being from here?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Nope, I don't.  I just play.  I know what I put into the game.  I know how true I am to the game.  I know how true I am to these fans.  So, no, I don't let it get to me.\nQ. Kyrie, you kind of laughed a little while ago when Dave said that LeBron either scored or assisted on 27 straight points.  Being in the game with him when he has a run like that, what is that like for you as another teammate?\r\nKYRIE IRVING: Special, very special.  You try not to sit back and watch because you're trying to make sure that you create space for him and able to give him outlets when he needs it, but I mean, when a guy's got it going like that, I mean, it's just unbelievable to be a part of.\r\nI'm not going to say exactly what he said to us on the bench, but we kind of knew what he was up to and what he was trying to do out there for us offensively.  It was just stay aggressive, stay aggressive.  That fourth quarter was unbelievable when he's playing in between like that mid-range, and outside, and driving to the rim, and also creating opportunities for all of us, it makes the game a lot easier.  And then we're getting out in transition, I mean, it's just unbelievable to be a part of.\nQ. People now will say that you and Steph Curry are the two greatest players on the planet, but they don't necessarily determine which one is the best.  You've competed so hard in this series.  You seem to take special delight sometimes in blocking his shot.  Tell me what that's been like to compete against a guy that's sort of vying for that title with you?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Oh, I mean, obviously, at the end of the day for me I think -- I don't really get involved in that.  I try to be the best player I can be for this team every night, lead these guys out.  I mean, I actually had a competitive shooting game with my kids last night.  You know, we were shooting baskets last night between myself and my two boys, which ended up not going so well for me at times.  You know, those guys have home-court advantage over me.\r\nBut at the end of the day my whole mindset is how I can put myself in position to help these guys be successful and I could be successful as well.  I don't really get caught up in what everybody else talks about.  I think you should know me by now.  I see what you're trying to do, though.\nQ. Kyrie, this may sound stupid, but on the court you said this would be the hardest thing you've ever had to do in a Game 7.  I'm just curious how do you know that, and what makes you say that?\r\nKYRIE IRVING: Well, me personally, I've said that since we entered The Finals to myself, but understanding that this will be.  It's the highest level of basketball I've ever played in my life, and going down and being in the position that we were in, being down 3-1, coming back home, understanding what was at stake and what we had to do in order to win basketball games.  I had to put it in perspective.  And when I do that, I just do everything possible to prepare as best I can.\r\nNow you just control what you can control, and you go on with that mindset that you just trust yourself, you trust your game, you trust your preparation, and you live with the results after that.  So I know that Game 7 will be the hardest thing ever though.\nQ. LeBron, your degree of confidence going into this game, has it changed much from the first time you went for a championship at St. V, when you were in high school?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, when you're prepared and you're well-prepared, then you have a lot of confidence going into a game.  I was a freshman at St. Mary, we were well prepared.  We had a great high school coach in Keith Dambrot, who is now the head coach at Akron U, who prepared us throughout the whole Playoffs, and then when we got to the state championships.  So we were prepared.  So we went out and just let it happen.  Let it play, and let it play out.\r\nNow at this point in my life, sitting here today, we're well prepared with T Lue and our coaching staff.  They prepare us, and it's up to us to go out and play, so we play with a lot of confidence and understanding that it's not -- there's nothing on the court that will blindside us because we're just a prepared bunch.\nQ. Obviously it took a lot from everyone, not just you, to fight back from down 3-1.  I wonder what it's taken just to get to this point, and what's left now for one more game?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: I guess we just take one day at a time.  We haven't rushed to get to a Game 5.  We didn't rush to get to a Game 6 today.  And we won't rush to get to a Game 7 on Sunday.  At the end of the day this is going to be it for all of us, including you guys.  One more game left, and you guys are going to give it all you've got, we're going to give it all we've got, and the Warriors will do the same, and we'll live with the results.  That's how you go about it.\r\nBut we won't rush it.  I won't rush it.  I'm going to sleep very well tonight.  I'll sleep very well the following night, watch a couple movies and just get ready to play.\r\nKYRIE IRVING: I won't rush it either.\nQ. Ty told us at the beginning of the fourth you said,\n\"I'm not coming out.\"  What is the mental process you use to shut off any physical exhaustion when you know you have to push through the fourth?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, Klay went on his own barrage for the last three-and-a-half minutes in the third quarter, and we were up 20 at one point and he kind of went on his own 12-0 run or whatever the case may be, just hitting threes, getting to the lane and just kind of took a little bit of momentum from us.  He looked at me and I was like, I just didn't want to come out.  I felt like those first couple minutes of the fourth quarter were going to be very important, and I just wanted to be out there for my teammates and try to make some plays happen, and I was fortunate enough to do that.\nQ. With all the offensive pyrotechnics that you and Kyrie and the statlines you're putting up, getting lost is the defense, four steals, three blocks.  That's become so typical for you and setting the tone for the whole team.  Can you talk about defense?  Because none of us would have imagined holding the Warriors down to 90 points, and things like that almost typically now.  Have you found such a defensive gear here in these Finals?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, you have to defend, and that's what we've all been talking about since we got together even from last year that in order for us to be ultimately successful, we have to defend, and I mean, if you don't defend versus these guys, you see what happened.  I mean, we've all seen it all year for the last couple years.  If you don't defend these guys or you make a mistake, they make you pay.\r\nSo our antennas have to be up throughout the course of a 48-minute game on every possession, because as soon as you make a mistake, they get a three here, they get a slip to the rim here.  They get offensive rebound and everyone's in the paint and they seek out to the perimeter for extra threes.  So our antennas just have to be up, and I think it's been there, not every game, not as well as we'd all like, but the last few games our antennas have been razor sharp.\nQ. Couple questions for you, Tristan:  Just in your role, how much satisfaction do you take leaving the building after kind of delivering the kind of performance you did in your role tonight?  And in that role, obviously, offensive rebounding is a big signature for you, when you're studying LeBron the way he's been -- how he's been attacking and shooting the last couple of games, what are you seeing from your perspective that's been a little different from what he had in the first three or four games?\r\nTRISTAN THOMPSON: To your first question, do your job.  Do your job.  Do it at a high level.  Give it everything you've got.  This is it.  This is it.  This is The Finals.  There's not much more to say about that.\r\nBut for LeBron, when he's attacking and getting to the rim or in a pick-and-roll, just find ways to get him open, setting a good screen or if they attract a double team, just get to the open area.  Get to the open area, and if he throws it, go up and finish strong, go up and finish strong because he's attracting the bigs, so you're going to have a small on you, so go up and finish strong and put it on the rim.\nQ. LeBron, I want to ask you about your relationship with Coach Lue and how the two of you feed off each other?  How would you compare him with many of the other coaches you've played for?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, I think all my coaches throughout my career have had a meaningful part of my career.  Everyone's been different in their own ways of how they philosophize the game and things of that nature, but I could talk in the present right now.  I think me and Coach Lue just kind of, we connect that's something that's bigger than basketball, our upbringing.  Being from a single-parent household, being from an inner-city community, being a statistic that you weren't supposed to make it out and there's no way you're going to make it out.  You're going to be another one of those African-American kids, and we both made it out from tough situations growing up, and people just saying there's no way you can do it.\r\nSo before we even met each other, you have a sense of that type of feeling.  Then I came into the league and I'm a huge basketball fan, obviously, and I watched The Finals when he was with the Lakers and seen the spark that he gave that team when Phil Jackson gave him the nod.  And I think everybody's just so caught up in the shot that AI (Allen Iverson) made when he stepped over him, but people don't realize the impact that he made on that team, and the guy that just accepted his role.  He's able to win a championship.\r\nSo our relationship has just grown over the years, and just being a competitor, going against him and then seeing him as a coach, going against him again when he was in Boston and things of that nature and with the Clippers, and then when I came back and he was the assistant coach, continues to grow.\r\nI think it's like anything, when you're around someone every single day, I guess it's like a marriage or a girlfriend.  You're around her every single day, they get better and better and better if it's genuine, and that's what it is here with myself and T Lue.\nQ. Kyrie and Tristan, what has LeBron meant to your growth as a basketball player?  Him being so great in setting the bar in another stratosphere, how do you come to work every single day to try to meet that level of expectations that he has?\r\nTRISTAN THOMPSON: It started last year after Labor Day.  LeBron sent a text to everyone, \"Let's get in early and start training.  Let's get ready for the season.\"  And we walk in and he's in a full-drenched sweat an hour before the meeting time.  So for a young player and for me and Kyrie, the first couple years, not being the best and being some tough years, seeing, in my eyes, one of the best players ever in a full drench of sweat working out, it gives you motivation as a young player.  It shows that if he's in the gym working his tail off and you guys know how good he is, I have no excuse.  I have no excuse not to be in the gym, getting extra work, getting extra shots, free throws, whatever it may be.  And just the way he plays it elevates everyone's game.  I'm blessed.\r\nKYRIE IRVING: Man, I'm going to save the long message because he knows how much he's meant to this team and then also to me personally, so it's been great.\nQ. You guys have been working since Labor Day.  Tristan will have played 103 games come Sunday.  When you factor in all the work that's gone on from September through tonight and how his game is predicated upon energy and effort, how impressive or how important is what he's been doing this late in the season?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: 103 consecutive games, correct?  I mean that's phenomenal.  It's a testament to his professionalism as a young guy, him keeping his body not only in shape but understanding that it's more than just playing basketball.  Kid takes care of his body every single day, he's been durable for this franchise even before I even came back.\r\nIt's a great feeling when you can walk into a building and know that that guy's going to be in uniform.  No matter what's going on, no matter what's happening, you know that guy's going to be in uniform and he's going to give it everything he's got.  It's been great, and 103 on Sunday, and hopefully out of all those games he's played, we want that one to be the best one he's played.  So look forward to it, and I'm done.  Thank you.\n",
  "Q. I asked T Lue the same question:  Given all the talk about iso basketball and kind of painting it collectively in a negative light, do you think it's unfair to chronicle all zero or one-dribble basketball as being something that's bad, or putting yourself at a disadvantage?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: I think it's a fine line, but I think true basketball people know the difference between certain iso basketball and others, and when too many dribbles of wearing a possession out and guys are not actively involved, there is a difference between that and also when guys are just attacking early in transition or they have a half-court matchup and able to go on that matchup.  So there's different forms of it.\nQ. I know you had talked to Adam [Silver] in the past couple years about concerns about schedule and things of that nature, the All-Star Break and stuff like that.  How much did you welcome the extra travel day when you're going cross country in a series of this magnitude?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, it benefits not only the players but also you guys as well, being able to get an extra day and prepare from coast to coast.  When I was in Miami we went to a couple places -- when I was in Miami, everywhere we went was far, and the last two years from us going Cleveland to Golden State, the one day in between was taxing on all of us.  Not just the guys on the court, but you guys as well.  So it benefits all of us as a league.\nQ. I can't remember if you've been asked this before during these Playoffs, but do you believe in momentum carrying from game to game within a series?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Yeah, I think that's always been the case in the postseason.  I think it also depends on the way you played and where you played at.  I think that helps.  But, I mean, both teams in this series have shown that they can win on each other's floor, so I don't think that matters much.\nQ. Kyrie was talking about this earlier, if you take away a five-minute stretch in Game 4, it's been pretty good for you guys the last three.  Do you feel like you have momentum to whatever degree it's there?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: I feel like we'll be prepared for Game 6.  Our coaching staff has given us another great game plan.  They're going to give us some more insight on what needs to be done tomorrow morning at our shootaround, and it's up to us as the guys to go out and execute that.\nQ. You stated many times that you came here because Kyrie was here already as sort of a franchise guy, but how much has your relationship grown with him over time, and how much have you tried to help expedite his growth into a star?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, I think when you're around someone every single day your relationship automatically grows.  But when you also share some of the same common goals, it helps that process a little bit faster than others.  I've watched the kid continue to grow over the last two years, and it's a benefit not only for himself individually, but for our team, for me, and for this franchise.\nQ. I don't know that you need any added motivation going into tomorrow night, but it's one year to the day tomorrow that the Warriors won in Game 6 in this building.  Do you guys take anything from not wanting to see that trophy hoisted in your building again?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: No, I mean, I don't think we even thought about it.  It's always one year to the date of something.  You can say that about anything.  I mean, yesterday was one year to date that my son turned 8, and yesterday he turned 9.  So it happens every year, it's one year to the date to something.  We don't think about that stuff.  We just get prepared to play.\nQ. This is a question not related to the game, but since there's been a lot of publicity yesterday and today about Godfather II, what is the phrase that you like more from the movie?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Oh, Godfather?  There's too many different phrases and too many different lines in that movie to just categorize one.\nQ. But which is the one that inspires or represents you more?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: I mean, each movie is nine hours long.  I mean, what do you want me to do?  I mean, there's so many.  I don't know.  I'll let you pick one and I'll roll with it.  It's a great trilogy.\nQ. Understanding that you and Kyrie had it going offensively the other night, what do you guys need from Kevin Love in Game 6 to do what you want to do?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Just need him to be aggressive.  You know, from the defensive side of the floor and the offensive side of the floor, go out and make an impact on the game, no matter if he's not scoring, no matter if at times he feels like he's not getting touches.  We all just need to continue to be aggressive.  He needs to be aggressive to help us try to send this game back to Golden State.\r\nI think he's looking forward to the challenge.  I think he's looking forward to the moment.  We definitely need him.  He's too big of a piece to our puzzle.\nQ. In that regard, do you need more than what he gave the other night?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: I think with everything that he gave us, I mean, he helped us win.  We needed everybody, all 15 guys.  Even the guys that never even touched the floor.  We had two guys in suits.  We needed everybody's contribution.\r\nWe definitely need Kev to play better.  We want him to play better, but we don't want to add no more stress on him or added pressure.  We just want him to go out and play, just let it hang out.\nQ. You've probably heard hundreds, if not thousands, pregame speeches from coaches over the course of your career.  Did anything resonate with you what Ty spoke to you guys about before Game 5?  What can that functionality, a coach talking to a team about philosophy before the floor, affect his team?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Oh, definitely.  His words resonate throughout the whole locker room, and some of the things he said I won't bring out to the table because it's for locker room use only.  But just his sense of calmness and his sense of just stay in the moment has definitely given, especially the young guys, just a confidence booster.  For us as a group, when you have someone that calm and collected about what needs to be done and just staying in the moment, it just helps us go out and do our job.\nQ. I'm sure you heard Andrew Bogut's out.  How does that impact you guys and your game plan, if at all?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: It doesn't.  We want to continue to attack.  We want to continue to not turn the ball over and stop those guys, Steph and Klay, from just having one of these barrages from the perimeter.  We also want to try to put pressure on those other guys.  Those other guys can beat you as well, with Draymond coming back and also Iguodala, and Livingston and Barnes and things of that nature, and even Andy gave them a big couple minutes last couple games, Speights as well, and everyone that they put in.\r\nEven with Bogut out, they still have so much firepower that it doesn't take any of the focus out of our mind going into Game 6.\nQ. When you see Draymond on the court, considering the exchange you guys had, will anything come to your mind when you see him out there on the court?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: My only job is to get this win, man.  We have a great opportunity to protect home court and go into two of the best words ever, and that's \"Game 7\".  So hopefully we can protect home.  That's all that matters.\nQ. Last year, obviously, you guys didn't have Kyrie and Kevin at this time, but what else is different about coming into Game 6 this year as opposed to last year?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: We didn't have Kyrie and Kevin (laughing).  Those guys are a big piece of what we do.  Obviously Kyrie has shown that and Kevin throughout this postseason as well.  I think Richard Jefferson has definitely given us a huge boost throughout the whole Playoffs, Channing Frye as well, even though his minutes have been a little bit limited in this Finals.  But in the postseason they've given us a boost.  And everyone that's come back from last year's roster has given us a huge boost to get to this point.\r\nSo we feel good about our chances.  We were also coming off a loss that we had our chances in Game 5 and a couple possessions down the stretch last year we just didn't communicate and they made us pay.  So we like our chances.\nQ. A lot was made comparing your game the other night to the Boston game a few years ago, and your numbers across the board in elimination games are very, very good.  Does something change for you when it's absolutely do or die like you've been saying, but it really is an elimination game?  What changes for you in that moment?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: I don't know.  I've just been fortunate enough to, I guess, make some shots, for one.  Grab some rebounds, find some teammates.  Guys put the ball in my face and get some blocks, and guys throw some errant passes and I'm able to get some steals.\nQ. That's it?  It's that simple?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: It's that simple.  It's not easy, but it's that simple.  I just go out and play.  I don't know what happens in elimination games.  I understand the magnitude of it, but it's not -- it doesn't bother me too much.  Just go out, and I know how much I put into the game.  I know how true I am to the game.  I know how much work that I put into the game when no cameras are around and things of that nature.  So I'm able to try to just bottle that, just bottle that and live with the results.  I mean, it's not always been great, but I guess the last few games, elimination games it's been pretty good, and hopefully I can continue that tomorrow.\n",
  "Q. For either one of you guys, how did Draymond Green's absence affect you offensively and also defensively?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I think from a mental standpoint it wasn't about anybody that was on the floor.  We just had a mindset that we wanted to come in here and just try to extend our period and have another opportunity to fight for another day.  And that was our main concern, and we were able to do that.\nQ. Kyrie, do you have anything to add?\r\nKYRIE IRVING: Yeah, I agree with LeBron.\nQ. Last year after Game 5, I think I asked you a question that made significant headlines, and the answer was very controversial.  Does a game like this in which you break crazy records, does it remind you of what inspired you to say that last year?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Our coaching staff gave us a great game plan, and as one of the leaders of the team, we just went out and executed.  You've got a guy like this who is very special, it's probably one of the greatest performances I've ever seen live.  To put on the show that he did, you just go out and follow the keys and play winning basketball, and we did that tonight.\nQ. The both of you carried the offensive load on scoring for your team.  Is that something that you can sustain?  Is that something that is welcome, or is that something that you need to go back a little bit to the drawing board and get it spread out a little bit more?\r\nKYRIE IRVING: I think our spacing was pretty good tonight in terms of where guys were positioning and our weakside action, which I've been talking about almost this whole series waiting for it to happen, and it happened.  Guys were in the spots, and it opened and allowed myself and LeBron to see a lot of driving lanes.  But also, if we saw guys coming over to help, we were ready to spread out to our teammates.\r\nNow, mind you, to repeat a performance like this would definitely be tough, but whatever it takes to win.  I know myself and he over there, as well as echoing to my teammates, are willing to do, and we'll be very well prepared for Game 6.\r\nBut that's the only thing that's on our mind right now.  We're not satisfied.  We understand the magnitude of what Game 6 means for us at home, and we know that it will be an incredible level that they're going to play at, and we have to play at an even better level.\nQ. Your efficiency tonight, you were scoring consistently throughout the game at a very high clip.  Is there something that -- is it a focus?  What enabled you to perform like that and carry that through over the course of the entire game?\r\nKYRIE IRVING: Just sticking with our game plan and going off the trust of my teammates as well as getting a lot of opportunities in transition that we weren't necessarily taking advantage of in Game 4, whether -- for whatever reason.  But I think as well is the way we spaced out our lineups and when guys were coming in, relieving us and giving us a few minutes here and there, it gave us an incredible amount of energy that we needed to sustain the high level that we were playing at.\nQ. LeBron, you just mentioned that Kyrie's game tonight was one of the best performances you've ever seen.  And maybe that will affect how you answer this, but how does your game, the way you played tonight, compare with your Boston game from 2012, the 45-15?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I think the main thing is that we were able to give ourselves another chance.  Going into Boston, being down 3-2, you know, we understood that, hey, listen, the season is over if we don't go out and try to take care of business.  Being a big part of our success, I had to come out and do some things to help us win that ballgame, and tonight was just another example of that.  Understood the magnitude of this game.  I knew how great of a team we were playing, but I just had to come out and just -- I know my teammates trust me, I trust them, and that was the result of it.\nQ. Both of you guys have talked all series about trying to play the right way and make sure other guys stay involved.  But I wanted to know, I'm curious, before this game did you guys know going in that it would have to take this, what you guys did, 82 points combined in order to get this win?  Did you know you had to take it to another level?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: At this point, it's whatever it takes.  Obviously making shots and things of that nature are something that you sometimes really can't control.  Sometimes the ball go in; sometimes it don't.  How hard you play, how locked in you are on the keys to get a victory, what the coaching staff put out for us.  But he was -- obviously this guy was special, and we rode him to the victory line.\nQ. Kyrie, the way you and LeBron match each other or mix with each other on the court has been scrutinized a lot the last two years in terms of whether there's redundant skills or whether you both need the ball in your hands.  Is this a testament to how you guys have been able to play off one another and enhance each other's game?  When did you find the right mix between each other?\r\nKYRIE IRVING: When we stopped caring about what everyone else said.  Honestly, what goes on in our locker room, I've said it multiple times, as long as we're taking care of what's going on in our locker room internally, we can power through anything.  Obviously it's not going to look perfect every single game, we understand that.\r\nBut I think that the trust factor was just a big thing.  It's just been continuous and been consistent as we've continued to grow together.  Just finding where he likes the ball, where he wants the ball, how effective he is around the perimeter as well as in the post and just giving him space to work, but as well as finding areas where I can be effective.\r\nThe value of both of us as well as the rest of the team and how we're spacing is very important, and it just took a while to figure that out.  But once we did, we just play our game and play basketball.  That's what it's about.\nQ. LeBron, you said this was one of the greatest performances you've ever seen in the Playoffs, and you've seen a lot of them.  Kyrie's only played six games in the NBA Finals.  What was it about his performance that really was epic for you?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Just calm.  Just calm for 48 minutes.  Obviously he played 40 minutes, but even in the 8 minutes that he was sitting down, he was just calm.  Timely bucket after bucket that led our team.  The fourth quarter, I mean, he hit timely shot after shot after shot when those guys were trying to get back into the game.\r\nDefensively he was phenomenal as well, guarding Steph and guarding the rest of those guys, whoever he was matched up on.  They tried to post him a few times with Harrison Barnes, and he just made it tough on him.  Got his hand on the ball a couple times on the post.  He was just locked in on both sides of the floor.  So that's what I saw, and that's why I said what I said.\nQ. Kyrie, when looking at the shots that you made, very few of them were really open looks.  I mean, Klay Thompson is a great defender.  What was it that you saw tonight that made the ball go in the basket so often?\r\nKYRIE IRVING: Just trusting the game, trusting the game plan, trusting my teammates.  And the spacing out there tonight allowed me to get to certain spots on the floor where I could be effective.\nQ. You seemed to have the ball in your hands more tonight than you have in quite a while, and Ty told us that was kind of by design.  Why was tonight the right time to go back to that, and why did you want the ball in your hands?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, it's the only time.  I mean, obviously it's do or die for us.  Coach Lue said he wanted the ball in my hands a little bit more.  I finally did a great job of not turning the ball over and got to my spots, got my teammates involved.  Just tried to put us in position to be successful.  Obviously it's not always a bed of roses on the court for 48 minutes, but you just try to go out there and trust your keys.  That's something I'm very comfortable with, and I've been comfortable with before in the past.  Coach wanted to make that adjustment, and I was able to take advantage of it when I had the ball in my hands.\nQ. You've obviously played against a lot of -- or been in a lot of venues that have been hostile throughout your career, including the last two games against Toronto.  How was it different tonight and how do you feed off the energy?  Do you enjoy making the crowd go home like that?  How do you feed off that energy?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I mean, I guess when you're done with a game of basketball and big moments like tonight and moments throughout your career you wish you could get back.  No matter how loud you turn the stereo system up in your house, you'll never be able to get it back.  You just don't take these moments for granted, no matter if you're at home or on the road.\nQ. Kyrie, just to follow up on Dave's question about when you guys started to click, you and LeBron.  Was that in the Playoffs?  The end of the season?  I just wondered if you could -- a certain point where you sort of felt like it finally felt right?\r\nKYRIE IRVING: To be honest with you, I can't give you like a specific date.\nQ. That's okay.  Maybe a month?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: That would classify as date (smiling).\r\nKYRIE IRVING: March, March -- no, I don't know (laughing).  The only thing that really matters is right now.  I'm sorry, I can't answer a specific date or something like that.\nQ. I was just thinking maybe the end of the last three or four weeks of the season.\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I think it was then.  I think it was like as soon as I was coming back to the team, I think we clicked right away.\r\nKYRIE IRVING: Yeah, when he announced he was coming back.  I think that's it (laughing).\nQ. Steph just scored five three-pointers.  How did you guys do that?\r\nKYRIE IRVING: We've got to be better in Game 6 in terms of the looks that he was getting that he normally makes.  We understand that we got lucky a few possessions where we have to stay locked in, including myself, where he's coming off those down screens.  We understand he's going to hit some tough shots, but we have to limit some of those opportunities.  He shot 14 of them coming off 11 in Game 4, I believe, and we just have to stay locked in and we have to be a little better.\nQ. Obviously, there's plenty of motivation for you guys going in down 3-1, but was there any added fuel extra at all after Klay said what he said yesterday, after Speights tweeting and some of the sniping that was going on yesterday?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: First of all, I'm not on social media right now, so I don't even know what Speights said, and I really don't think that even matters (laughing).  You guys make me laugh.  I swear, you guys do.\r\nMy only motivation is my teammates and my coaching staff, especially being in this building.  It's just us, us versus the Warriors.  They have an unbelievable fan base.  So many other things that we have to be challenged about.  So my only motivation is how can I be there for my teammates and my coaching staff.  That's it.  I mean, at the end of the day, nothing else really matters.\nQ. LeBron, it seemed like there was a little bit more action with you off the ball than maybe in Game 4.  You had that nice dunk on the backdoor cut.  I was curious if that was in there and what it does to have you moving off the ball as opposed to just holding it?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I pride myself on not holding the ball as much.  I did that early in my career, and I wasn't very successful.  So I understand how to play efficient basketball.\r\nAlso, when a guy has it going like Kyrie had it going, I'm able to find cracks and move without the ball and get it with the live dribble and things of that nature.  And all our teammates do a great job of keeping the space, keeping it available for me to cut through the lane and things of that nature.  Just try to be an outlet, an outlet when Kyrie doesn't feel like he has a great look and just try to put pressure on their defense.\n",
  "Q. In reference to this whole thing with Draymond Green, the Warriors players seemed concerned or upset about the fact that they said you stepped over him or the other word was straddled him.  Why did you do that?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, first of all, before we get started, I want to -- my condolences goes out to all the lost ones and families in the tragic shooting in Orlando.  I think it's another hit for us as Americans and what we have to deal with in our world today, and it definitely puts things in perspective on basketball.  For myself, it's just a small matter of what reality really is.  So my prayers to all the lost ones and all the ones that are recovering from this morning's tragedy in Orlando.\r\nTo get to your question, I don't really have an answer to it.  I'm not quite sure what any of the Warriors guys said.  I'm not a disrespectful guy.  I don't disrespect anybody.  It's all in competition, so I don't really have an answer to your question.\nQ. Well, let me follow up.  Were you aware at the time that you stepped over him?  Was it something that you didn't know that you did, or did you do it intentionally?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I was just trying to get back into the play.  I think what had happened was intentional.  I knew we got into a grapple at the top of the key, but me just trying to get back into the play.  That was my whole mindset.\nQ. After four games you are playing tomorrow an elimination game.  How hard is it for you to be in this situation?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: It's not hard.  I mean, you go out and you give everything that you have to your team and to your teammates, and you live with the results.  I put a lot of hard work into my career and into this year, so I know what I'm capable of doing.  I know what our team is capable of doing.  But it's not hard.  You just go out and do your job.\nQ. LeBron, when you're playing Draymond or anybody that was in Draymond's situation, how aware are you that he's one flagrant away from a suspension?  Does it affect how you go into a matchup like that?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I think something like that you're unaware.  I didn't even know at that point in time.  But you are aware of what's going on in the game.  You know if a guy has one foul, you know if a guy has two fouls.  You know if a guy has one technical or if a guy's injured or whatever the case may be.  Those things that are happening throughout the course of the game, you notice those things.\r\nBut you're not -- I've never been aware, okay, if a guy gets one more flagrant or if a guy gets, I don't know, one more penalty point -- I'm not quite sure of all that stuff.  I'm not aware of that.\nQ. LeBron, the other night you said you didn't expect the NBA to assess a flagrant.  I believe your answer was:  No, I don't expect them to do it.  Were you surprised by today's decision to assess a flagrant?  And do you think that resulting suspension is fair?  Did you feel like it was a flagrant?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I think the league handled it as they felt they wanted to handle it, and that's their call.  It's been their call all year.  Us as players, we've got to play on no matter what happens.  You can't -- you can either go with what the league says or you don't, but at the end of the day they make the final decisions.\nQ. You were pretty upset, obviously, on the court at that moment.  Did you feel like it was a flagrant foul?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I felt like at that point in time it was a little bit outside of basketball.\nQ. You know the history.  You know no team's ever come back from 3-1 in The Finals.  Does this give you guys a little bit of a lift or a spark maybe that you needed?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: At the end of the day, it doesn't.  For our team, we know how dangerous they are no matter who's in the lineup.  I mean, obviously we saw what they were able to do without Steph for two weeks, playing against Houston and playing against Portland.  Those guys still complement each other, no matter who's out on the floor.\r\nSo we have to be, obviously, much better than we were in Game 4 in order to try to get a win in a building where they've been very successful.\nQ. Just to pick up on your comments there at the end.  Obviously the first two Finals went their way in Oracle.  How do you nullify that away-court issue?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, not many teams have been successful here.  But at the end of the day, we just have to play better.  I think our first two games we had way too many turnovers which resulted in those guys getting out on the break.  I think we averaged 18 turnovers for 25 points in Game 1 to Game 2.  No matter how well you play, that's not good ingredients for a victory on anyone's floor, especially not on the defending champion floor.\nQ. When the Warriors were up here, there was some talk about what trash talk crosses the line and what doesn't.  Klay Thompson said:  I guess he just got his feelings hurt.  You talked about being a prideful guy and some comments Draymond made.  Would you discuss that whole issue of what's fair and not fair on the court?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: What happened?  What Klay said?\nQ. Yeah, and what crosses the line.\r\nLEBRON JAMES: No, I'm not -- what did you say Klay said?\nQ. Klay said:  I guess he just got his feelings hurt.\r\nLEBRON JAMES: (Laughing) Oh, my goodness.\nQ. I believe the transcript will support that.\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I'm not going to comment on what Klay said, because I know where it can go from this sit-in.  It's so hard to take the high road.  I've been doing it for 13 years.  It's so hard to continue to do it, and I'm going to do it again.\r\nAt the end of the day, we've got to go out and show up and play better tomorrow night; and if we don't, then they're going to be back-to-back champion, and that's it.\r\nBut I've taken the high road again.\nQ. After last game you said you were slightly perplexed about the lack of calls against your defenders when you're playing as aggressive as you are.  Do you think that will change?  Do you expect it to change as the series progressed?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I can't.  I mean, for me, you control what you control, and that's something that myself and our team can't control.  What we can control is how aggressive we play on both ends of the floor.  Our coaching staff will prepare us the best way to go out and win Game 5, and it's up to us to go out and execute it.\nQ. LeBron, you've been involved in the last two playoff series where the team has a 3-1 advantage.  You know, obviously with Miami you got wiped out at San Antonio, and then when you were with Miami before you took it to Oklahoma City.  How do you avoid basically that not happening again when you're around the others?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, you have to take one possession at a time.  You can't start the first quarter thinking about the third quarter.  You can't start the second quarter thinking about the fourth quarter.  Every possession matters, and especially when you're in a do-or-die game, which it is for us, obviously.  You know, so we've got to just take every possession as the last and move on to the next one as they carry on throughout the game.\nQ. Especially on the road it's tough because they can steamroll against you too?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: This team could steamroll against anybody on any court (laughing), so that's the actualization about it all.\nQ. I know you were in the middle of The Finals, and maybe a big-picture question doesn't work here, but you wanted to come back to Cleveland for one reason.  And I wonder, having seen this team come together over the last two years and now being healthy and having the run that you had, just the kind of over-arching pressure you continue to feel to try to deliver that with a team that is really I think everything that you wanted and everything that they were able to do for you and how you deal with that facing an elimination game like this?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, for me, I think from a basketball standpoint, that's one of the reasons why I came back, but it's not the main reason I came back.  It wasn't the only reason I came back, and there wasn't just one reason why I came back.\r\nMe personally, what I'm able to do off the floor as well with my foundation and me being back home and me being -- last summer I was able to guarantee all my kids in my program college scholarships.  I'm able to do so many things because I'm actually there, hands on, with my foundation and things that go on.  I'm able to up lift the youth in my community and also in other communities.  Even though you're able to do it from afar, if you're actually there, I think it's even more meaningful to kids that look up to you for inspiration.\r\nThen from a basketball standpoint, yeah, I mean, that's always been my goal since I was drafted in 2003.  I was drafted in 2003.  My goal was to bring a championship to Cleveland, and it hasn't changed.  When I left, my goal was to bring a championship to Miami.  That didn't change.  And when I came back, it hasn't changed.\r\nSo, ever since, for me -- since I went to high school in '99, that's been my goal, since '99, was to win a state championship, to win an NBA Championship.  So that goal has never changed.\nQ. With your 13 years of experience, as you pointed out earlier, though, does it give you perspective that no matter what I do or how hard I play or the leadership that I show that there may be some years that it just doesn't happen?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, at the end of the day you control what you can control.  You dedicate yourself to the game, you be true to the game.  I commit myself to those 14 guys and our coaching staff and our fans every single night that I step on the floor.  At the end of the day, win, lose or draw, I'm not happy, but I'm okay with it because I know I've given all I've got.\r\nI don't know if there's anyone that's been in the league and won a championship every single year they've been in the league.  Unless they played one year, won a championship as a rookie and then they retire.\r\nOne thing I can say that I've been blessed enough to be a part of seven Finals, and hopefully I'll be blessed enough to play in many more even after this year, win, lose or draw.\nQ. How has I guess the line of what's too far in trash talking changed since you've been in the league?  Like what's the line now and what was it then?  Also, I know you and Draymond are friends.  How is your relationship after this?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I don't think that's changed.  I think we all know what's crossing the line no matter if you're playing basketball or if you're playing video games or we're playing catch or you're double-dutching it.  I mean, we know what's crossing the line.  We know what words cross the line, male or female.  And ever since Draymond came into the league, I've been someone that he can always talk to and things of that nature.  But he crossed the line last game.  He felt like I crossed the line.  We said what we had to say.  So we're in a competitive series right now, and I think right now friendship is the last thing we're thinking about.\n",
  "Q. LeBron, Steph hit the three, and it was like 5:55 left in the fourth quarter, and you guys called a timeout.  You guys came out of timeout.  Can you talk about if that was exactly what you guys wanted?  It seemed like after that the offense kind of sputtered.\r\nLeBRON JAMES: I don't know.  I'm trying to replay it back.  I'm not quite sure what we ran out of timeout.\nQ. They went up nine.  They went up nine at that point.\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Yeah, I'm not sure what we ran out the timeout when we came back out on the floor.  But our offense did stall a little bit in the fourth quarter.  We played a little bit too much random, trying to dribble drive, get guys looks, and then we started settling a little bit for the three-point shot when we kind of got down.  Which obviously we've got to do a better job of that.\r\nBut we had our chances.  I think the third quarter was a momentum swing for us, and they took advantage of it.\nQ. What is your mindset heading into the next game?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: My mindset is get one.  You know, we've got to go out there and play obviously better than we played tonight.  Better than even we played in Game 3.  But we've got to get one.  It's not about overlooking this.  It's about getting one on their home floor where they've been very successful.  So, you know, we've got to come in with the mindset that our coaching staff is going to give us a great game plan and we've got to execute that.  We're about the results after.\nQ. LeBron, you had words with Draymond and Steph.  What kind of got you going and what were you saying to them?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Oh, nothing got me going.  You know, Draymond just said something that I don't agree with.  I'm all cool with the competition.  I'm all fine with that, but some of the words that came out of his mouth were a little bit overboard, and being a guy with pride, a guy with three kids and a family, things of that nature, some things just go overboard and that's where he took it, and that was it.\nQ. Anything with Steph?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: No, no.  That conversation was competitive conversation.  I'm okay with that.\nQ. I think you had four free throws tonight the entire game.  Just your thoughts on that and some of the calls tonight?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, it's been like that all year for the most part.  I'm not quite sure what I can do personally to get to the free-throw line, but I've got to continue to be aggressive for our team.  I'm getting hit, but the refs are not seeing it that way, on my drives.  But I've got to continue to be aggressive for our team.  That's who I am, that's what opens up the floor for a lot of our shooters, and just worry about the results afterwards.\r\nYou know, it's tough playing 46 minutes and only going to the line four times, as much as I attack the rim.  So it's just a tough situation for our team.\nQ. I do have a question for Kyrie, too, but I wanted to follow up with Draymond.  LeBron, I think you've seen it now, he got you in the groin during that.  Especially given Draymond's situation with the flagrants and whatnot, do you have any opinion on what happened there, what should happen?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, I don't know what should happen.  It's not my call.  That's the league office.  They'll take a look at it.  We all saw it in the locker room.  You know, like I said, as a competitor, I love going against Draymond, and I'm all about going out there and leaving it out on the floor.  But when it gets a little bit more than what it should be, that's what caused me to have words with him.\r\nSo as far as the play, I think the league will take a look at it.  Obviously our locker room has seen it, and we'll see what they say.\nQ. Do you expect that the league -- whether or not you think they should, do you expect that they would?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: No.\nQ. And Kyrie, you're off to such a hot start and it looked like you hurt your hand or something.  What happened to it, and did it affect you at all as you went along?\r\nKYRIE IRVING: No, just a bruise.  That's all.\nQ. LeBron, what do you tell yourself the next two-and-a-half days?  And what do you tell your guys the next two-and-a-half days when you know the enormity now with the chips stacked against you?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Obviously, if you want to look to that side, then you put too much pressure on yourself.  I think for me as the leader of this team, we've just got to get one.  Let's get one.  We've already got to take a flight home back anyways, so we might as well come home with a win and play on our home floor again.  Being a confident bunch we feel like the chips have been stacked up against us all year anyway.\r\nSo we've got to learn from our mistakes tonight, which we made some and we go out with the mindset let's get one and then bring it home.\nQ. Kyrie, did you find anything personally offensively in games 3 and 4 that maybe you didn't have in games 1 and 2, and can you use that moving forward in the series?\r\nKYRIE IRVING: Well, I have no choice at this point.  I'm following this guy to my right's lead.  Game 3 and 4 I've been put in positions to be successful and our guys have trusted me to be aggressive, whether that be in transition or in the half court.  Our one-four pick-and-roll with LeBron playing the four has been working for us great.  So we just have to be better in Game 5, and come in with the mindset to be aggressive for however many minutes we, myself and everyone else needs to play.\r\nBut I know the echo and the attitude of effort and things that we can control going into Game 5 will be at an all-time high, and the next two-and-a-half days will be a lot of preparation learning from our mistakes and moving on and preparing for Game 5.\nQ. For either of you guys, did you feel the fatigue played a factor at all in this game?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: No.  Not at all.\r\nKYRIE IRVING: No excuses.\nQ. LeBron, for you, you and Kyrie combined for 33 of the 38 shot attempts in the second half.  Is that a number that you're comfortable with in a game?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, we've got to be aggressive.  Our coach, Coach Lue told us to be aggressive.  And obviously, we don't like to hear it in that form.  We want to get our guys involved and keep our guys in a good rhythm.  I just think it was just the way the game played out tonight.\nQ. For both of you guys, the story of the first three games in large part was how Curry was having trouble affecting the games, he sort of got loose from you guys tonight.  What did you both see that they did so successful compared to the other three games?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, first of all, he's a great player, and we know that.  And we knew he was going to come out and be aggressive.  Because of how the first three games went, and we knew he was going to be aggressive.\r\nWe made some mistakes and he made us pay for them.  He made us pay every time we made a mistake defensively, and he shot the ball extremely well from the three-point line.  We tried to keep a body on him when he went to the paint, where he struggled a little bit, but when he went to the three-point line, he made us pay.\nQ. Beginning of the fourth quarter you guys are up by two points.  They go on a big run and rip off a 12-1 run.  You guys sort of, it was like you were playing in quicksand a little bit there.  What was the experience like as that's sort of starting to happen for you?  What was changing for them that was making it more difficult for you to get stops?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: They started making shots and then they started getting stops.  They did it on both sides of the floor.  It starts with, I believe, Harrison Barnes'  three at the top of the key.  That was a big shot to kind of get their rhythm going.  Then they got some offensive rebounds, some second-chance points and then defensively they got stops.\nQ. Kyrie, it seemed like in Game 3 you guys really were dedicated to keeping J.R. involved, kept going to him even after a couple early misses.  What can you guys do for Game 5 to get him more attempts and keep him going?\r\nKYRIE IRVING: Just making sure that we're putting him in spots to be successful, especially in transition.  Getting him shots early and often and having him feel good, especially throughout the game.  There were a few tough ones that he had to take into the shot clock, but for us, we're going to continue to go to J.R. no matter what.  I mean, he's a big part of our team and we know the impact that he has to have in order for us to be successful as a team.\nQ. LeBron, from Game 1 you talked about turnovers.  You got a couple of high-turnover games, this one included.  But you just talked about the referees.  Do you believe some of those turnovers are being called because you're not getting the calls or is it something else that's going on?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: I didn't talk about the referees.  I was asked a question and I answered it.  I'm going to save my 25K, okay.  So I have not talked about the referees.  Don't put me in that cloud.  I haven't been solid with the basketball.  A lot of it is making plays not only for myself but for my teammates.\r\nSome of my aggression turnovers I'm okay with.  I think I had two careless ones.  One came at the end of the game where Steph picked it off.  Another one came early in the third quarter where Bogut trapped the box and I tried to hit Double T.  Draymond stepped in front of it.  But some of them were attack turnovers.  Trying to squeeze the ball into tight places as a quarterback would, and I'm okay with those.  But some of those that are careless, I'm not okay with that.\nQ. You guys got Kevin Love back tonight, and he talked about being accepting of his role coming off the bench.  I wonder what impact you felt that had getting him back in the lineup, and how that might help you guys going forward?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, for two years, any time we've gotten anyone back from injury or sickness or whatever, it's been a boost for our team, and tonight was another one.  I mean, getting them back, seeing him out on the floor and him making the impact, especially in the first half when he hit a couple shots, he was able to get a layup off a offensive rebound.  He started the fourth on a post-up, that was a big play for us.\r\nSo I know he probably felt out of rhythm.  It was a different situation for him that he hasn't experienced in quite a few years.  But anytime we get someone back from injury or anything, it's a boost for our team.\n",
  "Q. LeBron, I'm just curious, when you found out Kevin wasn't playing and that you were going to basically be defending Draymond last night, what approach and what did you set out to do mostly against him?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, it's a different mindset when you know you're starting off on the perimeter compared to when you're starting off on a big.  You have to change your mind frame.  You have to change mentally, actually thinking as a big, and that was my mindset.  When I knew Kevin wasn't playing and Coach said I was starting on Draymond, I had to transition myself into being a big and guarding a big and getting into the scuffle and things of that nature.\r\nSo it's just a different approach, which I'm fine by making that transition.\nQ. Even though you say you approach it as a big, he initiates so much of their offense from well above the three-point arc.  It looked like you made it a priority to get way up on him, even way above the arc.  How do you think that affected their offense or helped you guys from an aggressive standpoint defensively?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, I think not only myself, but everyone.  Everyone extended their defense a little bit more.  They're such a great three-point shooting team that you have to extend your defense to start off with.  More than that, they move the ball so, so well.  And Draymond being one of those guys, one of their playmakers along with Steph, along with Livingston, along with Iguodala that makes so many great passes above that, well beyond the three-point line.\r\nSo, you've got to do a good job of trying to help the back-line defense by putting a little ball pressure on them.\nQ. Last night, LeBron, you talked about how a lot of the things that Richard Jefferson does doesn't show up in the stat sheet.  Can you just elaborate on what those intangibles are and what you're seeing out on the court that kind of helped you guys with your rhythm and play last night?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: He's a professional.  He's a true professional, and a guy who is seizing an opportunity and moment to be in this position.  The last time he was in The Finals was his first and second year in the league, and I think he's not taking this moment for granted.  He's just going out and giving everything that he has.\r\nHe knows his role.  He plays it very well, and he's key to our team.\nQ. I'd like to follow up on Draymond before I ask my own question:  You're always such a game-plan guy.  You'll do whatever it is that Ty lays out.  But when you have a night like last matching up with Draymond, and it worked out as well as it did for you and the club, would that be a situation where you'd go to Ty and say, leave this matchup alone?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, myself and Coach Lue, we talk a lot about game plan, and at the end of the day he has the last say so.  And then it's for me to go relay it to the rest of the group and get those guys to buy in on what needs to be done to help us win.\r\nSo we have a lot of conversations throughout the whole year on what should we do and how we can be better as a ballclub, and he would give his last decision.  Then it's for me to go and take it to the team and make sure they're prepared.\nQ. Prior to last night the Warriors had beaten you guys seven in a row, did that at any point start to build up kind of a mental block for your team?  And when you win one, when you snap a streak like that, what can it do from a confidence level going against a team like the Warriors?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: I don't think anyone actually knew the number or how many consecutive times they had beaten us.  We just knew they had beat us in Game 1 and Game 2, and they beat us pretty well on their home floor.  We wanted to just come out with a better effort, sustain a better effort as close to 48 minutes as possible and live with the results.\r\nBut I don't think anyone in our locker room actually knew how many times they had beat us in a row.\nQ. What have you learned about this team, the makeup of the locker room that lets you know that you might be able to handle any changes that potentially come to the lineup if Kevin is able to play on Friday night?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, in the last two years we've had some extreme situations happen to us, both with two of our All-Stars being out because of injury.  At the start of this season, obviously with Shump being out and also Kyrie being out for a long extended period of time, so guys have been able to just -- \"next man up\", that's always been our motto.  For someone that's out and can't perform or can't play at that point in time, then it's next man up.  Our coaching staff does a great job of keeping everybody engaged, keeping everybody afloat or understanding, hey, you never know what may happen, so always be ready.  So that allows our team to be able to make the adjustment on the fly, if need be.\nQ. LeBron, how important is it for the collective when Steph is around the lane or cutting under the basket, making a baseline cut, just within the letter of the law of course, making sure he feels you guys in some way?  How much has that been a point of emphasis for you guys?  Because it seems like last night was more so for 1 and 2.\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, I think, that's for all of their guys, not just Steph.  They do a great job of the ball moving, and when you allow those guys to move with freedom of space, they're very dangerous.  They're already dangerous enough.  So when you allow them to run around and not feel any pressure or any physicality or anything, you know, they're able to just be even more comfortable.\r\nThey're already a great team, and you just want to try to take something away from it because of how well they move the ball and how well they share the ball and how great of three-point shooters that Steph and Klay are, and the rest of those guys feed off of them.\nQ. And you talked before 3 for obvious reasons about do or die.  Now that it's 2-1 and you won a game by 30 or whatever it was last night, how do you keep that same edge?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: It's the same.  It's the same mindset.  We can't afford to go down 3-1 and go into their building and give them confidence going back.  So it's a do-or-die game for us still.\nQ. LeBron, Tyronn shared a story with us that both you and Kyrie went up to Kevin before the game last night and said, \"We've got to win this one for you.\"  What's it been like noticing the frustration he's dealing with with the protocol, and also, what can you do to support him throughout this process?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, I just seen it on his face yesterday when we were all in the locker room, and it was that I-hate-that-I'm-going-through-this moment.  I-feel-like-I'm-letting-you-guys-down moment without him actually even saying it.  So before we left the locker room, I know Kyrie embraced him, I did as well.  Told him, don't worry about it.  We've got him tonight.  This is what a team is all about for them to pick their brother up in a time of need, and him not to put too much pressure on himself or the team, and that we're going to try to take care of business, which we were able to do.\r\nSo I know it was uplifting to him, for sure, and it was for our team as well.\nQ. You said a couple days ago you really didn't know what playing possessed meant.  But I think like Game 6, 2012 Eastern Conference Finals with Heat against the Celtics, I think you went 45 and 16, and you kind of looked like you were in a different state of mind that night.  Was there any comparison between that night, if you look back to last night, and how you'll approach tomorrow?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: I think for me it's just I just play my game.  I love to play the game.  And obviously being down 3-2 in Boston at that point in time, it was do or die.  I mean, it was year two for us, and we had already lost the previous year, and we had so many high hopes that year, and being down 3-2 going into Boston, it was a tough situation for us.\r\nSo just try to go out there and play the game that I love to play, trust the work I've put into it and let the chips fall where they may, and I did the same thing last night.\nQ. Were you in a different state of mind that night four years ago that you've been since, or was that just a great game?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: I wasn't in a different state of mind.  I was just focused like I always am.  I was focused on what the job at hand.  I play the game with a lot of joy and a lot of fun.  A camera can always catch you doing anything and they can always put a caption on it all the time.  So, you know, that's one of the pictures that came out kind of saw me bent over and just looking at one of my teammates shooting free throws, and it said, he looks like a man possessed, and I don't even remember what I was thinking about.\nQ. What does Ty bring to the team as a coach that's unique and special?  And why do the players like him so much?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: For one, he just brings a sense of calmness no matter the situation.  Just like he came in here before Game 3 and told you guys we're not worried about being down 0-2.  We're back on our home floor and we look forward to going out and playing our best basketball.  When you have that from the general, you know, for us, we go out there and follow his command.\r\nAlso he's one of the few coaches in our league or he's one of the few coaches in our league that you can relate to because he has some of the same upbringings as some of us.  Growing up in the inner city, single-parent household, being a statistic, so I can relate to him a lot.  Just understanding how the odds are always built up against you growing up and you make it.  So at this point everything else is kind of extra credit because you've already succeeded in life.  So everything else is extra credit, so you can relate to that as a player to a coach.\nQ. LeBron, when you decided to come back here, how prepared do you think Kyrie as a No. 1 draft pick and franchise guy was prepared?  How prepared do you think he was for any changes in his role or the pecking order?  And now that you have been back and seeing him up close for two years as opposed to an interested observer, what adjustments have you seen?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: I don't think anyone was prepared for me returning and understanding what the situation was going to entail.  I mean, that's everyone here.  You know, they had gone through some losing seasons in my previous stint before I came back, so they knew they were getting a pretty good basketball player and a great leader and a good person, and someone that was going to command excellence.  But I don't know if they understood the day-to-day process of being in this situation was going to entail.\r\nSo it's been a learning experience for everyone that's been a part of it to this point, and including myself.  I've actually learned some things as well about the guys and about how to be patient with younger guys and things of that nature.\r\nBut if I could look at the first day I returned to now, our floor general, Kyrie, has become such a great leader.  Every single day he's learning, every day.  And last night was a prime example of that, him going out and playing the way he did, commanding the way he did, getting guys involved the way he did.  You know, that's just a true testament of someone who has a growth mindset and being able to grow every single day under these circumstances.\nQ. You probably would have welcomed it, but when you were a young player, if you'd had a multiple All-Star, one of the best in the game dropped in your lap.  What sort of a challenge would that have been for you?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Oh, I'd play with anybody.  I don't really care.  I can play with anybody.  I can play with multiple All-Stars.  I can play with young guys.  I can play with older guys.  It would have been great to get a multiple All-Star, someone who had done something in our league to come to this team when I was a young guy to kind of help me along the way as well.  But it didn't happen, so I had to learn on my own.\n",
  "Q. Gentlemen, the Cavaliers have effectively frozen the pond for the Splash Brothers during the first three games of The Finals.  What are you doing differently?  How are you keeping them from getting to their spots, getting open looks, and how do you plan to maintain that momentum in Game 4 on Friday night?\r\nKYRIE IRVING: It's just team awareness, especially with those two guys, knowing their impact and how they can affect the game.  Those guys can get it going in bunches, and you saw Steph in the third quarter, as well as Klay in the second quarter when those guys just have the ability to get downhill, as well as spray out to the three-point line.  So just having our antennas on the defensive end, but as well as making them work on the offensive end while we're just being aggressive.\r\nGuys were getting in spots, and it's both teams are getting up and down the floor.  Being able to shoot jump shots effectively while guys are getting up and down, you know, the three-pointer, that you come down and shoot on the first possession is a little different from the eighth possession.  Guys are in your face, and we just try to make it difficult for those guys.\r\nBut it's a total team effort on our end, and Swish [J.R. Smith] does a great job on Klay.  I just try to pick up Steph as high as possible, and our bigs do a great job getting up to touch.  So great job on just total team awareness.\nQ. Kyrie, you looked like a different player tonight.  You were very aggressive.  Your coach talked about it.  What made the difference for you, and also if you could talk about your passing connection with LeBron tonight, which worked well for you?\r\nKYRIE IRVING: We just talked about our 1-4 in shootaround, our 1-4 in pick-and-roll with me and him, with us leading our guys offensively.  It's just working really well for us, as well as the switches.  I know that I can't play in between or be indecisive, especially with guys in front of me.  Just constantly in attack mode.  I know my teammates consistently want me to do that, possession by possession, whether it's getting downhill or shooting jump shots or whatever it is.\r\nYou know, it was two games, going from Game 1 of playing a little bit too much iso, and then Game 2, kind of just not being in my rhythm, in my rhythm and then coming into Game 3 it was, I don't want to say a completely different player, but it's just back to just not really thinking about anything except for being aggressive for my teammates.\nQ. LeBron, for somebody who understands the history of the game as well as you do, best two teams in basketball in theory.  How do you equate losing by 30 and winning by 30 in such short order?  Especially when you're whole to start one game, and then not whole with Kevin in the locker room, how do you make sense of the 63-point turnaround?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: At the end of the day, no matter if you lose by 30 or 1, it's just one win.  And you have to be able to have a short mind but also learn from the mistakes that you made the previous game and just try to better yourself in the following game.  And that's what we're able to do.  We had a great shootaround yesterday.  We had a great shootaround this morning.  Coach Lue and the coaching staff gave us a great game plan and it was just up to us to go out and execute that, and I think we did that tonight.\nQ. LeBron, for a couple days you had talked about needing to compete harder and play harder, effort.  Ty just said the same thing.  In a Finals, how can that be the issue?  Do you feel like your guys have gotten over it?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Don't think it's an issue.  You know, it's just something that we wanted to pinpoint and do better.  You could say we wanted to move the ball better the next game.  We want to dribble-drive the next game.  Those are not issues.  Those are things that we want to be better at in the next game, and I think we did that tonight.\nQ. LeBron, can you recall a play previously in your career where you were on the floor after a steal and were able to recover and get up?  And then J.R. said he doesn't like to throw good lobs on purpose.  Kyrie, were you trying to do that as well?\r\nKYRIE IRVING: I wanted to see something great.  I threw it very, very -- you know, some people may say it's a bad pass, but I wanted to see something great, and for him to do that, it was awesome.  It was awesome.\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, it started with the defense just trying to get my hand on Steph's pass, and I was able to get a deflection, and he kind of bumped me a little bit, kind of threw me off a little bit, and I was able to regather from off the floor.  I knew we had a break going, and I didn't know exactly which one of my teammates was running the left wing until I got back up off the ground and saw Kyrie.  I threw it to Kyrie and I made, I think it was Klay, just shift a little bit, and I knew he was going to throw it up there.  And I had to go get it.  He threw it, I had to go get it.\nQ. So much was made of the narrative of the second units and the difference of the contributions.  Now you win a Game 120-90.  But the first unit, you guys went 105-57.  How do you make sense of that kind of dominance between the starting lineups against that team?  Offense, defense, can you describe what the key is there to win by 50 points?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, they're a great team and they have a great starting lineup, and they have great complementary players that come off the bench.  It's never about us versus their starting five.  It's about the whole 15 group.  Our 15 guys versus their 15 guys and who can execute as close to 48 minutes as possible.\r\nWe did a great job, and I gave the game ball to RJ.  Getting the start tonight with Kevin being out, he just came in with so much aggression, so much attention to detail.  He was on the glass.  He gave us eight rebounds and nine points.  But some of the things that he was doing out on the floor did not show up in the boxscore.\r\nSo we just want to try to play our game.  We finally got back to our game tonight, and it started with the floor general to my left.  The sharpshooter to my right got it going, and it was just good basketball.  It was a good flow, and everyone felt like they were a part of tonight's win.  So it was just a collective team win.  It wasn't about us versus their starting five.  It was just about how everyone can get the job done whoever is on the floor.\nQ. J.R., given the way that the first two games of The Finals went for you, what did it mean to seemingly have the first play of the game called for you to get a three?  How does that help your confidence to get one of those shots up early?\r\nJ.R. SMITH: I mean, it really doesn't do much for my confidence, honestly.  I let that side of my brain turn off.  I mean, I look at it, it's a great opportunity to start the game off, but I know how I want to dictate the game, and that's on the defensive end and trying to stop Klay as much as I can.  Try not to let him catch the ball.  Make it tough for him as much as I can, and let that dictate my offense.  Let that dictate my offensive transition, get open shots, play from there.\r\nBut for the most part, I mean, it's great.  Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the look, but it's not really what I'm looking for.\nQ. J.R., did anybody say or your teammates say anything to encourage you just because I think you only had eight points in the first two games that you had to get your rhythm back?  Even though that shot at halftime didn't count, did that give you a lift?\r\nJ.R. SMITH: I mean, once we got home, honestly --  well, since 1 and 2, my teammates have been talking to me, stay aggressive, be aggressive.  When you get the ball, take your shot.  If you don't have it, give it up.  But for the most part everybody's been supportive.  Since we landed the other day, it was pretty much like a clean slate.  Get back in the gym.  Get back to our routines.  Drive the same route I go to the gym every day, and just get back on our home floor and play the right way.\nQ. LeBron, tonight I think you started 4-of-4 and then you struggled and got it going in the second half.  Can you take us through your roller coaster shooting, and what got you going again in that second half, especially with your jumper?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: My teammates got me going.  They told me to be aggressive, and that's what I was.\nQ. J.R., LeBron was heard in the pregame huddle saying, \"Follow my lead.\"  When he tells you that, what does that mean to you?  And Kyrie, what does that mean to you and what's the impact?\r\nJ.R. SMITH: I mean, for me I just know he's going to go out there and be aggressive on both ends.  I know he's going to go out there and communicate and be the quarterback for us.  When that happens, like he said, just follow his lead.  I've just got to be that lockdown corner that I am when I'm playing my game, and just follow his lead as much as I can until it's time for Kyrie to take over.  It's kind of early, but it helps.\r\nKYRIE IRVING: Just realizing the magnitude of what's about to happen, going out there and battling, understanding that we're being led by a great player.  We all understood that.  We all know our roles.  We know what to expect from one another, but the platform that we're on, understanding the moment, he does a great job of dialing us in.  We understood coming back home.  Didn't necessarily play well on the road, now we're coming back.  Our leader is looking us all eye to eye and telling us, let's go to war.\nQ. LeBron how different is this team when it gets a contribution like it did tonight from Jump Shot Jesus over here?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, I mean, he's like you said, he's a two-way player.  Defensively all year long that's what he's been doing.  The offense comes very free to him and very easy, but the defensive side is what's making him so great.  The contribution that we got from him from the scoring was all predicated on what he did defensively, you know, and he got in great rhythm.  He hit some huge shots for us tonight, obviously, but I think it all started on the defensive end where he was much better than he was offensively.\nQ. There was a play after the whistle where Steph was trying to go up and do a lay-up or a dunk I guess to try to get it him rhythm and you blocked his shot.  Was that a way to set the tone that there wasn't going to be any easy shots tonight?  And can you talk a little bit about how much better your defensive communication was tonight.\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Oh, well, when you have the greatest shooter in the world trying to get an easy one or trying to get in rhythm, it's our job to try to keep him out.  No matter if it's after the whistle or not.  That was just my mindset.  Anytime, if you're a great player and you see the ball go in, no matter if it's after the play or during the play, then you start feeling it.  Not that you feel good because you know what you're capable of, but it helps.  So I didn't want him to see the ball go in, even though he still made some.\nQ. Kyrie, we talked a little bit on Monday about aggressiveness and playing between it and things like that.  But that was mostly in regard to your shooting.  Obviously in the first quarter you lit it up from a shooting standpoint, but you also had three assists.  Was there a concerted effort to facilitate as much as you did in that first quarter as well?\r\nKYRIE IRVING: Just understanding spacing and where guys were going to be.  I knew that getting down and getting into the paint, I'm able to be aggressive for my shot.  But in the beginning of the game, I just knew where guys were going to be.  I'm coming off pick-and-rolls, and we have guys in specific spots, and they just made my job a lot easier coming in and seeing a lot of bodies in the paint, and I am able to just draw some eyes and kick out to our shooters.\nQ. How much did you playing in the post tonight change the dynamic of this game?  And what was your approach to Draymond?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, I mean, I just wanted to play a little bit inside and outside.  I started off the game going in the interior and just trying to fan out their defense a little bit.  We did a great job of spacing out with RJ, with Ky, and also with Swish, so it gave me a little bit more room to work down in the post.\r\nI missed a ton of chippies, but I was loving the space that I was getting and my teammates created for me.  So just kind of following the game plan.  It's something that we wanted to do tonight and were able to execute it.\nQ. How much did you guys change defensively what you wanted to do?  It looked like you weren't switching as much as you were in the first two.\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Coaching staff gave us a game plan and we went out and executed it.\nQ. You've heard it from us over the last couple days of asking you if you're going to take over this game, if you're going to do this or do that.  When it was official that Kevin Love was going to be out for this game, did you have to change your approach at all going into this game or you pretty much played like yourself?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: No, I didn't change my approach, and I didn't take over this game.  Kyrie pretty much took over the game, especially early and late.  He closed the game out.  He started the game, and I just sprinkled in, you know, my production along the whole game.\r\nHe took the game over, I guess, from that standpoint.  I just try to lead these guys to victory.\n",
  "Q. Just wanted to ask, in light of Steph Curry pulling out of the Olympics yesterday, I wondered, one, if you've made any sort of decision on that yet, the series not being over?  And two, what will be the key factors that go into the consideration of whether you would play in the Olympics one way or the other?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, I'm just now hearing about Steph pulling out.  But my decision has never been on anyone either playing on the team or being invited or not playing.  I haven't made a decision yet, and I probably will make it right after the season's over.\nQ. Ty said after Game 2 that you guys need to be more physical defensively, kind of alluding to the style you played last year.  Is this team capable of playing that style again, and why, what was working defensively last year that is not working now?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, I haven't looked at last year's postseason.  A lot of things have changed from last year, a lot of different circumstances, a lot of different rotations have changed.  But if that's what Coach Lue wants us to do, and we have to follow his game plan, and we have to do it.  If guys are out there not following the game plan, then he has to sub them out, and other guys have to come in and do what he wants to do.  He's the commander, and we've got to go out there and do it.\nQ. LeBron, everyone always says bench players, the role players play better at home.  Besides that and familiarity, sleeping in your own bed, what goes into the homecourt advantage?  You guys are unbeaten so far, they had their way out there.\r\nLeBRON JAMES: We're a confident bunch especially at home, definitely our role players have given us a huge boost throughout this postseason.  Not only on the road, but especially at home, our fans have done a great job of giving us everything and it's our job to kind of give it back to them.  So I know the guys are excited about the opportunity to get back out there tomorrow night and defend home court as we've done so far in this postseason.\nQ. LeBron, I asked Coach Lue if there's anything that you could do to improve your game moving into Game 3, and one of the things he said is just be more aggressive.  When you're more aggressive, what does that entail in your game?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, for me, I try to do whatever it takes to help our team win, and I do everything offensively, defensively, getting guys involved, rebounding, everything, so my game doesn't waver one way or the other.  I'm not a pure scorer.  I'm not an all-assist guy.  I'm not just a rebounder.  I do everything.  So for me I said that after Game 2 that I've got to play better, but as far as my numbers, I don't worry about that.\nQ. Is there anything specific?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Nothing specific.  I've just got to go out there and play better.\nQ. Kevin's been such a big part of this postseason for you guys.  How do things change if you can't go tomorrow night and beyond?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: It's going to be the next man up.  We're down 0-2, and we can't afford to look and say, \"Wow, Kev's not playing.  What are we going to do?\"  It's next man up, because it's a must-win for us.\r\nSo obviously his health is very important, but in the situation we're in now, we've got to stay confident.  And whoever Coach decides to give the nod to got to be ready to go, and everybody else has to step up.\nQ. It's been a long time since you've been down 0-2 in the series, but the last two times, one was against the Pistons in '07 and you guys came back and won that, and the other one was the Celtics the next year and you forced a Game 7.  Do you rely at all on those two experiences as you approach this 0-2 deficit?  What is it?  How do you climb out of an 0-2 hole?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: I don't know.  I don't really think about past experiences too much.  This moment is what it is today.  You do a great job of taking me back.  You love my history.  You always take me back and make me go back (smiling).\nQ. One of these days you're going to (inaudible).\r\nLeBRON JAMES: When I'm done we can talk about the history of it.  But I'm the leader of this team, and we have other guys that are ready to step up.  Obviously, it's a do-or-die game for us.  We can't afford to go down 3-0 to any team, especially a team that's 73-9 in the regular season and playing the type of basketball they're playing.  So it's a do-or-die game for us, and we understand that.\r\nSo we're going to come in and give everything that we've got and leave it on the floor.\nQ. Do you guys need more three-point makes and attempts?  Is it necessary?  What can be done to maybe free up some shots at the three-point line?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, I think being aggressive, getting into the paint.  Then if we can make a couple shots at the rim, which we have not been so successful with in this two-game series so far, it will start opening up our guys on the perimeter.  So myself, and Kyrie and hopefully Kevin, we can attract some more defenders and get some bodies off some of our shooters, we can allow those guys to get open.  But they've done a great job, and I know it's a game plan of those guys to take away our three-point shooters.  They've seen what we've done so far in the postseason.  They've done a great job of slowing them down so far.\nQ. This is a bit off the beaten path, but I know you made some dietary changes a couple years ago to make your game better, to slim down.  We saw the pictures.  What kind of things do you have to avoid?  And what is the hardest thing after the game that you reach for that you can't end up having?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Well, I think right now it's not as strict as it's been in the past.  But obviously when you get to a point in your career where you know what benefits you more than others, then you're able to stay away from it, and it's very difficult being in a household with three kids where there's a lot of junk food around and things of that nature and they're running around and putting it in your face.  It's very difficult.  Every now and then I'll dab with them a little bit.  Either, I say to make them happy, but it's actually making me happy (laughing).\nQ. What are we talking, Cheetos, Doritos?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: I don't want to talk specifics unless they want to -- if I say it, then I've got to get a phone call from one of them (laughing).\nQ. When the Raptors tied the series at two last round, you said there was no need to panic.  You've been in a lot of adverse situations and you said that wasn't one of them at that time.  The Warriors, they just took care of home court, but it seemed like the way they did it and the size and their advantage, does this qualify as an adverse period?  And if so, how does that change what you say to the team or approach?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: I think Game 1 we played good basketball.  They just took care of business for 12 minutes and took us out the game, and that was the fourth quarter.  Game 2 for two-and-a-half quarters they pretty much did what they wanted to do.  So for about four quarters of two games they've played some great basketball.  They've played as great as I've seen them play, which is not always -- you wish you were not on the other side of that.  But I don't think it's an adverse moment, but I would say that we all can sit here and say there is no way we can go down 3-0, you know.  And I'm not a big history guy, even though I love the history of the sport, but I don't like to put myself in it.  But coming back home and understanding this is our home floor and we've played some really good basketball, we can't afford to go down 3-0, especially against this team.\r\nSo it will be more adversity if we got to that point, which I don't believe we will.\nQ. With the way Golden State plays on offense, do you think if you guys played better on offense that could help your defense just with the rebounds and such?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: Yeah, of course.  If we can score a little bit more, which I believe we will do in Game 3, that will help our defense out a lot, too.  When you miss versus those guys it gives them the ability to get out and run, which they're very good at.  Either from Draymond pushing the break or Iguodala pushing the break or Steph and those guys run the floor and they run to their spots and create a lot of problems.  So if they're taking the ball out of bounds, then it slows it up just a little bit.  So we've got to do a better job of putting the ball in the basket.\nQ. Phil Jackson commented on the NBA Finals yesterday, and he said he coached Michael in a series in '93 when the Bulls were down 2-0 to the Knicks and he played like a man possessed in order to bring the team back.  Do you have to get yourself to a different level mentally?  Does the idea of being a man possessed, could that help you turn the series around?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: I mean, what does that actually mean?  I mean, I think for me to go out and be who I am and play as true to the game and as hard as I can and try to lead this team, that's who I am.  Not anybody else.  I'm not Michael.  I'm not Ali.  I'm not nobody else that's done so many great things for sport.  I am who I am, and if I'm able to go out and put together a game like that, it wasn't because I was possessed.  It's because I worked on my craft all season long and that's the result of it.\r\nPhil's a great coach.  Mike's a great player.  But I am who I am.\nQ. It's just common sense that guys like you who touch the ball every trip, you're going to turn it over from time to time obviously.  I mean you beat yourself up pretty good after the game Sunday night.  How quickly did it take you to turn the page off that?  When you went back and studied it, was it something you chalked up to the way they were playing you or were there some things that you wish you had back?\r\nLeBRON JAMES: It was a little bit of both.  I watched the game as soon as I got on the bus.  First time in a while I caught the first bus leaving the arena.  And myself and James Jones sat next to each other on the bus and watched the game, all the way to the hotel back to San Francisco.  And I seen some of them that were uncharacteristic, but some of them were being aggressive, and they just got their hands on a few of them.  A couple of them were bad footwork; I traveled and a few of the third-quarter moves where I just took an extra step and wasn't as sound with my footwork.  So that's something I can clean up.\r\nSo, you know, I'm out there making plays for myself and making plays for my teammates as well.  So you're going to have some turnovers, but some of them I can clean up for sure.  So out of the seven, I would say four of them I can clean up and stop those guys from getting out on the break and doing what they do best, and that's filling the lanes and sharing the ball.  I'll be much better and much more sound tomorrow night.\n",
  "Q. At this point, are you frustrated or disappointed with your team, with the performance after Game 1 and 2?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Neither.  I'm not disappointed in our guys or frustrated.  We've just got to do a better job.  We've got to be better at all facets of the game both offensively and defensively, both physically and mentally.\r\nThey just beat us at every -- we didn't win anything.  No points of the game did we beat them in anything.  Even when we had an early lead, they beat us to 50-50 balls, they got extra possessions, they got extra tip-ins.  They beat us pretty good tonight.\nQ. I realize you're a team player, but is there a point where you say I have to be more selfish to help my team out in this series?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Selfish is probably the wrong term.  I got myself in a lot of trouble tonight personally.  Turned the ball over way too much.  And I said after Game 1 we just can't turn the ball over against a great team and expect to win, and I had basically half of the turnovers.  We had some in the fourth quarter, but we had our third group in.  They had some.  But I had half of the turnovers when I came out, and it resulted in them getting some easy baskets.\r\nSo I've got to be better.  I've got to be better with the ball.  You know, trying to play make for myself and play make for my teammates at the same time, I've just got to be more solid.\nQ. Just following up on the turnover situation.  You guys didn't have any turnovers in the first quarter, and you held them to 19 points.  Do you feel one of the key things to get this turned around at home is if you can keep those turnovers down you can slow down the game, and, like you said, keep them out of transition?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, that's one of them.  That's one way to slow them down a little bit.  You're able to set your defense.  The game kind of broke open when we had two straight turnovers.  I think game was at 28-22, I turned the ball over.  Draymond got it and was able to hit I think Livingston for a dunk.  And then we had another turnover and Klay hit a three, and that kind of slowed us down.  Even though we were still getting back in the game, it just slowed us down from that point on.  We had the lead, and it started with my turnover, and I can't just be careless with the ball, especially in the paint where a lot of reaching and things of that nature happen.\r\nSo 18 turnovers once again for 26 points, I think it was 17 for 25 in Game 1.  It's just not good basketball.\nQ. You gave your squad headphones before the game today with an inspirational quote.  What was your message to them and did they receive it?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I give my teammates stuff throughout the whole year.  All the time.  It's no different.  We understand the moment that we're in, and it's not -- it's not every year that you get an opportunity to be in this situation, you know?  And some of the guys on our team, it's their first time and they've waited their whole life to get to this point.\r\nSo we know we've got to just do a little bit better.  We've got to play better.  We've got to play a lot better in order to get this series turned around.  I know the other side is looking forward to coming to our building where they had a lot of success last year, so we've got to bear down.\nQ. Last year with all the injuries and the adversity and the odds, you know, you guys just gutted your way to two wins.  Now you've got -- until Kevin went down, but otherwise everybody was healthy, and Ty Lue's here and everything.  Most of the buttons he had pushed had been working.  Is there a sense that maybe you guys are just let down because of what you've done through all these Playoffs just isn't working?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: We've got to get back to the film and we all have to figure out ways we can help the team be successful.  It's hard for me to kind of pinpoint what's not working and what could work right now.  Obviously not much is working, especially offensively.  Defensively we've been good at times and then at times we just looked like, okay, we're a step slow.  We messed up on the coverage.  We don't get back or we're just one step behind where we should be.  We should be closer to our man.  When you're behind these guys, they make you pay every single time.\r\nWe can't have as many mental lapses.  More on the physical, it's a lot of mental as well.  These guys put you in so many mental positions where you have to figure it out, and they make you pay for it when you don't.\nQ. LeBron, the last couple months you guys are the team they've been talking about, how different you guys are.  You're different, you're not the team from last year this season.  In these last two games in particular, has it been that you guys have slipped and fallen from what has made you different, or is it something the Warriors have done to take away what you guys have established?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: What we've done these last two games doesn't put a damper or a cloud over how we got to this point.  We're still here and we have a chance to turn this series around if we come in and do what we need to do both offensively and defensively.  So I'm not worried about that side or what the conversations may be about.  Internally we have to figure out how we can be better.  We have to figure out how we can help one another.  We definitely have to figure out how we can get more guys involved.  15 assists, it's not winning basketball, especially versus this team.  We've just got to figure it out.  Coaching staff will give us a game plan, and it's up to us to go out and execute it.\nQ. After the 2014 Finals, I remember you were asked was that the best team you've ever faced, and you said, yeah, I'd agree with that.  Have these Warriors changed your mind on that?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: 2014 is something I haven't even thought about.  This is a great team, and I stated that before the series ever started.  They've got two of the best shooters that we've ever seen, and they're a great team.  So I've already stated that.\nQ. You are shouldering some of the blame for this and say you didn't live up to the way you like to play.  How do you process a loss when you do feel like it could be part of your fault versus maybe it's out of your control?  What are the next couple days going to be like for you?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: The next couple days will be not -- I won't be reflecting.  I'll figure out ways I can be better, starting as soon as I leave this podium.  Probably go back to the room and watch the game, re-watch for ways I could have been better.  I had a lot of uncharacteristic unforced turnovers which resulted in those guys getting 26 points off turnovers.  So I'm one of the guys who kind of always wants to shoulder the blame and take the blame when we don't play as well as we should.  It's just who I am, and I've got to be better.\nQ. Draymond Green has never scored more than 16 points against you guys in a Finals game until tonight.  What was it about everything that happened in that game that made Draymond such a force at both ends of the floor tonight?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: He made shots.  Give credit where credit is due.  The guy made shots.  Not only when we left him open and contested late, but he made shots in our face.  He had five threes.  And we know he's a key for their team, we all know that, an All-Star for their team.  And he made some big plays both offensively and defensively, obviously.  We know what he does defensively for that team, so game ball to him.\n",
  "Q. In what way do you tie the avenue for athletes to become global icons to Muhammad Ali?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Can you kind of clarify that question a little bit more?\nQ. Do you at all see a sense of debt or maybe see the groundwork that he laid for athletes to become global brands, the world renowned that comes for people in your position today, to what degree do you tie that to Muhammad Ali?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: First of all, my condolences goes to the Ali family.  Rest his soul to the goat.  I'm not sure I'm going to answer your question exactly how you wanted to, but so many thoughts come to mind when I think about the man who passed away yesterday, what he represented.\r\nAs a kid I gravitated towards him because he was a champion, but I only knew as a kid of what he did inside the ring.  As I got older and I started to be more knowledgeable about the sport, about sport in general and about the guys who paved the way for guys like myself, I understood that he is the greatest of all time, and he was the greatest of all time because of what he did outside of the ring.\r\nObviously, we knew how great of a boxer he was, but I think that was only 20% of what made him as great as he was.  What he stood for, I mean, it's a guy who basically had to give up a belt and relish everything that he had done because of what he believed in and ended up in jail because of his beliefs.  It's a guy who stood up for so many different things throughout the times where it was so difficult for African-Americans to even walk in the streets.\r\nFor an athlete like myself today, without Muhammad Ali, I wouldn't be sitting up here talking in front of you guys.  I wouldn't be able to walk in restaurants.  I wouldn't be able to go anywhere where blacks weren't allowed back in those days because of guys like Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown, Oscar Robertson, Bill Russell, Lew Alcindor, Jackie Robinson, and the list goes on and on.\r\nSo when an icon like Muhammad Ali passes away, it's just very emotional.  It's also gratifying to know that that guy, one man, would sacrifice so much of his individual life knowing that it would better the next generation of men and women after him.\r\nSo today I can sit and go to China and make trips to China and all over the world and people know my name and know my face.  I give all credit to Muhammad Ali because he was the first icon.  He is the goat.  He is the greatest of all time, and it has zero to do with his accomplishments inside the ring.  So hopefully I was able to cover it.\nQ. Again a little bit on Ali, you touched on the courage he had to show to take stands.  You've had some taste of that.  You've made your feelings known on some pretty touchy issues.  What is that like to kind of put yourself out there like that and should athletes do more of it?  Some do, some don't.  Michael made his -- he made it a point of not doing that at times.\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I just think it's in you.  If it's in you, then it will be brought to light.  If it's not, then it won't.  I would never compare myself to Muhammad Ali because I never had to go through what those guys had to go through back in those times.  But in my own daily struggles, as I continue to say, growing up in the inner city, being a statistic that was supposed to go the other way and I'm able to sit up here today and knowing that I was a guy who beat the odds, it's just you never take for granted the path and the guys who just every single day just struggled in their individual lives and everything they had to go through on a daily basis for us, for a guy like myself.\r\nYes, I've had some adverse moments in my life and, yes, I've had to deal with a lot of things as a professional, and I've spoken up on a lot of issues that other athletes may not speak upon, but I feel it's my duty to carry on the legacy of the guys who did it before me.\nQ. LeBron, you were one of the players that spoke out about the injustice about Trayvon Martin when you were a member of the Miami Heat.  Can you talk about the legacy, the type of legacy that Muhammad Ali will leave on this Earth?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I think what's unfortunate sometimes where some of our greats and some of our role models and some of our leaders is that we don't appreciate them until they're gone, and I think that's unfortunate.  But I think in Muhammad's case, I hope we were able to appreciate him from the time that he was set or stepped foot on Earth.  And along his path from a kid all the way to a teenager all the way to an adult and to a father and so on and so on, his legacy will obviously live on.\r\nIt's funny, last night we were back at the hotel, and a good friend of mine, a role model friend of mine who actually grew up in the same hometown as Muhammad Ali and kind of around the same age, he put on last night, on the TV where we were, the Thrilla in Manila, the fight between Ali and Frazier.  It was just an unbelievable pound-for-pound slugfest, but just two greats just seizing the opportunity and seizing the moment to be in it and do what they love to do.\r\nIt sent a lot of emotions through all of us just in that room watching it.  Like I said, I had an opportunity to meet him a few times, and for him to be able to fight the disease that he had for so long, I think three decades he had that disease for, and still be able to recognize and do the things that he wanted to do and live on, he's a powerful man.\nQ. We appreciate your words.  But changing a little bit the subject and going back to the series.  When it comes to a situation to fight back, let's forget about the numbers.  Let's forget about the stats.  What is the recipe for success going into tomorrow's game?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I think the recipe for success and a basketball game are two different things.  But I think for tomorrow's game we have to be more sharp than we were in Game 1.  And that's not saying we weren't sharp.  We played some really good basketball, but he made too many mistakes.  As I stated after the game on Thursday night, 17 turnovers for 25 points, doesn't matter if you hold Steph and Klay under 10, doesn't matter if Shaun Livingston gets 20 and Iguodala and all those guys played great or even if they didn't play so great, you cannot give up 25 points off turnovers on the road, especially against such a great team.  It's not a good ingredient for success.  So we have to do a better job of that.\nQ. Kyrie was already a pretty good player when you got here.  In what ways the last two years and what direction have you kind of tried to push him to become a more complete player?  And where do you think he is in that process?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I just wanted to be someone to help him get to a point -- I think his talent has always been there.  We all saw that, since he was drafted to Cleveland and his first few years with the team.  What I wanted to -- once I came back, I wanted to see if I could help him grow as a leader, help him grow as a basketball player, help him grow and understanding how important and how fragile these opportunities are.\r\nAnd he's just shown growth every single day.  He's a young man still.  I think the kid's only 24 years old.  He's still a young man, but he's accepted the challenge of being much more vocal, much more hands on as a leader of the team.  He's the quarterback with the plays, with the playbook on his wrist.  When you see the quarterback kind of -- you know.  I'm kind of the offensive coordinator and T. Lue is the head coach and he's the quarterback and he has to go out and make the right reads.\r\nThe kid has grown in the two years that I've been here, so far.\nQ. He was a scorer, had to be a scorer early on when you get here.  Did you try to emphasize passing more, ball movement more?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: He's still a scorer.  That's what he does.  He gets buckets.  That's how he says it.  He can score with the best of them in our league.  And you never want to take that aggression away from him.  As a team, we know as a team, not just Kyrie, we know as a full 15-man roster, when the ball is moving and the ball has energy behind it, we're all in good rhythm.  And that's part of the reason why we're here again.\nQ. Staying on Kyrie, a lot has been made about this series, the matchup between you and Steph Curry, but he actually plays the same position as Steph.  Have you had conversations with him or counsel with him about embracing that challenge, that matchup, but, again, as you mentioned, kind of staying in the team game?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: At the end of the day it's not about myself or Steph or Klay or Kyrie or Draymond and the list goes on and on.  It's about the Warriors and the Cavs.  You win a championship, we all don't get an individual trophy, you know (laughing).  You all get your individual rings.  But at the end of the day, it's about a team.  This is one of the greatest ultimate sport team games.  So it's not about that.\r\nI think as an individual, when you're going against the best, your competitive side automatically kicks in.  So no matter who is across from you, you want to be able to hold your end of the bargain against the guy across from you.  So that's just competitive nature.  I think everyone knows that.  But we don't come into a game saying, okay, it's Kyrie versus Steph.  It's Swish versus Klay.  This is our game plan, they have their game plan, and it's who executes it the best.\nQ. What's your relationship with Dan Gilbert like this year and since you've been back in Cleveland?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I think it's been very good.  At the end of the day, we have the same goal, and that is to bring a championship to Cleveland.  And that's all that matters.  I think he's the owner of the team.  I'm just one of the players and one of the 15 guys.  So I'm one of the lower guys on the totem pole, so I just do my job.  I'm just here to work.\nQ. You're one of the lower guys on the totem pole?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Yeah, just tall.\n",
  "Q. Ty mentioned a minute ago that he spoke with you this morning about playing faster.  What did you see and do you feel like that is something that you need to do going into Game 2?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I mean, Coach has given us a game plan, and we need to execute it.  If Coach feels like we need to play faster, then we do.  We've got to push the tempo a little bit more offensively, see if we can get down, get some easy baskets and get to the flow of our game.\r\nIt's been a good thing for us throughout the whole season once Coach Lue took over, so we need to do that.\nQ. He also mentioned that the way they're defending and switching that this is the kind of series for isolation ball, and it's something that we've talked about that you ask Kyrie can do very well.  Do you feel like if you just play a little better that this is the kind of series where you can thrive in isolation?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, it's a fine line.  You know, when you're out there and they're switching and you have a one-on-one matchup, I think quick moves and not holding it as long is good.  I think when you keep the ball on one side for too long and you're pounding and pounding and pounding, then that can -- too much of that won't result in good basketball.  It won't result in good rhythm for everyone out on the floor.\r\nSo there is a fine line.  I'm okay with us having some isolation basketball if we're going quick.  But we're holding the ball and we're just staring down the defense and we're staring down the ball, then it can become a problem for us.\nQ. There is a stat out there that you're 9-0 after losing Game 1 in the postseason.  That's a pretty staggering number.  I'm curious if you have any thoughts as to why that is?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Say that again?\nQ. You're 9-0 in Game 2 after losing Game 1 in the postseason.  That's a pretty high number.\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't know.  My team has always been able to recalibrate, look at the mistakes that we had in Game 1, I guess, and come up with a better game plan in Game 2 and be able to execute it.  So I've been a part of some resilient teams that's bounced back from a Game 1 loss either at home or on the road.\nQ. If I could follow up, when Ty said that he showed you guys clips of all the lay-ups, that you guys blew eight or nine lay-ups at the rim that weren't even contested.  So after you watch the film, do you leave that game encouraged that it really wasn't as far off as maybe the score indicated, or are you still discouraged that on a night Steph and Klay don't play well that you still lose by 15?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: No, I'm not discouraged at all.  I understand we had our opportunities.  We played some good basketball for 36 minutes, and the fourth quarter got away from us.  We definitely missed some really easy looks.  Some looks that we're accustomed to making that we've made all year long.  But not discouraged in the fact that we were able to get into the paint, get where we want to go, but we've got to be able to knock them home.\r\nAs far as Steph and Klay, at the end of day those guys and this team is here not just because of those two, and we have to respect the rest of those guys like we respect Steph and Klay, those guys that are either on the floor or the guys that enter the ballgame.\nQ. The Cavs just scored seven three-pointers last night compared to the Eastern games.  It's not good.  Do you know what is the reason?  Is it because of the Warriors defense or a bad night?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't understand your question, to be honest.\nQ. The Cavs scored seven three-pointers last night compared to when you played the Eastern games.  It's not good.  Do you know what is the reason, was it the Warriors defense or did you have a bad night?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: We just want to play our game.  Play our game offensively and defensively and live with the results.\nQ. You have experienced both pursuing championships and defending championships.  I wonder from your perspective, once you win one, is there a pressure removed that allows a team to play more freely the following season?  And when you're in pursuit of one, is that pressure something that's very difficult to get out from under?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I think it's a little bit of both, but another year of experience definitely allows your team to play free, to know and expect out of the guy beside you.  You just know when you go through -- when you're able to finally accomplish winning a championship, you know how hard it is to win that.  You know exactly what to expect out of the guy next to you from that point on because you've been through so much.  There's no easy route to winning a championship.  So that allows the game to be easier.\nQ. LeBron, is there anything you guys can do as a team to get J.R. going offensively?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: He's a huge part of our success, and we've got to do a better job of trying to get him some looks early on and just to keep him engaged throughout the whole game.  Three shot attempts is not enough for him.  He had a big fall to start the game that really bothered him.\r\nBut we've still got to keep him involved where he doesn't feel like he's just chasing around Steph and chasing around Klay all game, things of that nature.  He's a big piece of our team, for sure, so we've got to find ways to get him looks.\nQ. LeBron, what did you think about the way you guys defended them, and are there a lot of changes you have to make on that end of the floor, or is it mainly offense?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I think we defended them well, not great.  I think we cannot relax when those guys make their subs.  Livingston, Barbosa, Iguodala, those guys come into the game and they change tempo and they play with just as much confidence as Steph and Klay and Draymond.  And we have to understand that we have to treat those guys, like I said, like All-Stars, just like Steph and Klay and Draymond are.\nQ. Is that kind of like human nature when Steph and Klay are out to relax because you know those guys shoot so well and they're not out there anywhere?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: It's not that we relax.  It's just that when you have two of the greatest shooters in the game, they come out and you know your defense doesn't have to be so extended.  We all know that Livingston doesn't shoot threes.  Iguodala shoots some.  But they're not like Steph and Klay where your defense has to be extended to half court.\r\nWhen those guys come in, you're able to shrink your defense a little bit more, so you tend to -- I don't want to say relax, but your defense is picked up a little bit lower so those guys get to where they want to get to.  They get to their sweet spots.  We may have to change that approach a little bit.\nQ. Last night you guarded Steph on several possessions.  Is that Coach's plan or just you wanted to take the challenge?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Both, both.\nQ. To touch on their bench again, a couple of players told me that they were a little winded having to chase Steph and Klay around.  Is there a team other than the Warriors out there that comes to -- that can prepare a team to chase those guys and then have to exert just as much energy for those guys coming off the bench?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, no other team in our league has the two best shooters in the league on the same team.  And no other team in our league has that many playmakers.  I mean, people look at Steph and Klay, but when you add Draymond and Livingston and Iguodala, it adds playmakers.  You know, so you can't just key in on one guy.  Those guys can all make a play for not only themselves, but for others.\r\nUs having six days off definitely, I guess, wore on some of our guys' legs from a fatigue standpoint.  But it is what it is.  We're in The Finals at this point.  So I think it was good though to get that first game out of the way.\nQ. As a leader, what is the message for your team after this loss going into Game 2?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, we've got to be better.  We've got to be much better going into Game 2.  I don't think we're that far off.  You just know that you cannot -- when you're playing against a team this great, you cannot make mistakes or you have to limit your mistakes.  Even with how well they played off the bench, outscoring us 45-10, you also can't combat that by having 17 turnovers for 45 points in their building.  It's just not a success for winning.\nQ. We keep talking about the bench and the numbers staggering, 45-10.  Your guys' depth has been such a strength throughout the course of the regular season, the postseason.  At some point can you just say we've got to stick with these guys on your team and maybe know that you have the faith in what they've already accomplished?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Oh, absolutely.  I mean, from one game you don't just throw -- like I said before, even after, I think it was after Game 4 in the Toronto series you guys asked me about taking the series over or whatever the case may be because Kyrie and Kev had struggled a little bit.  But we got to this point because our bench has been so productive.  We got to the point in the Toronto series because Kyrie and Kev carried us along that way.\r\nSo you don't just throw everything away over one game.  Our bench has been so productive for us.  They know they're going to have to have a great series in order for us to win it.  So we have a lot of pride in there from our bench, and I know they're going to take that even better going into Game 2.\nQ. Yesterday in the game at the end of the third, beginning of the fourth, when you sat out they took the lead, went up by 14, that's also during the time of the Delly common foul discussion.  Do you get a breather there?  Was that just part of normal rotation minutes, or did you need a rest?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: It was part of the normal rotation.  I usually come out at the end of the third anyways.  I was able to get a little more extra rest because of the referees going to review what had happened.  But, yeah.\nQ. Do you feel that maybe you could have gotten in earlier, maybe talked with the coach?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: When it went up 14 in like 14 seconds?  How much earlier do you want me to go back in?\n",
  "Q. You guys came out really strong in the third quarter, got a lead.  It seemed like you had the momentum and then there was that small altercation with Delly and Iguodala.  Did that break you guys, the momentum, and did you feel like you guys kind of maybe lost your composure after that happened?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: No, we're not a team that loses our composure over anything.  We played well in the third quarter to get ourselves back into the game, even taking the lead a couple times.  It was a six-point game to start the fourth, and we just didn't start the quarter like we should have, and they did a great job of pushing the lead up to double digits really fast.\nQ. Obviously holding Steph and Klay to a combined 20 would seem to be a great blueprint.  Is it discouraging to then see their bench erupt for 45?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: When you get outscored 45-10 on the bench and give up 25 points off 17 turnovers, no matter what someone does or doesn't do, it's going to be hard to win, especially on the road.  And that's what it was.  Obviously the game ball goes to Shaun Livingston.  Came in, gave them a huge spark.\r\nBut don't matter what you do with Steph and Klay, don't matter what you do with Draymond.  Give up 45 points off the bench and 25 points off turnovers on the road, it's not a good ingredient to win.\nQ. LeBron, taking a step way back from it all, this is your seventh Finals, and I think you've only won Game 1 once.  So you've been in this situation a bunch.  What do you make of just what happened tonight and where you are now and just how you get into this series?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, we've got to be much better in Game 2, obviously.  I think defensively we had a game plan and we followed it as much as possible.  Well, as great as we could for 48 minutes.  We had some breakdowns, which we know we can get better with.  Offensively, we've got to be much better.  We've got to be much better moving the ball, moving bodies.  They're a great team when you just hold the ball and pound the ball.  So we've got to do a better job with that, which Coach Lue and the coaching staff will make sure we do in Game 2.\r\nSo we look forward to the challenge again.  Just two days in between doesn't help.  It doesn't feel good.  But it gives our body a chance to get some rest.\nQ. LeBron, obviously this team and this series is a lot different than last year.  But how much different after this game here do you think it is?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't quite get your question.\nQ. The Warriors roster is the same, but last year it was Curry, it was Klay and some of those guys taking over.  But after Game 1, having the bench go and score 45 points, does that change your view of how this series might go and what you have to prepare for?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I think you're wrong in the fact of saying it was just Klay and Steph.  I mean, they got to the point where they were last year and won a championship because of their whole team and their bench.  And they're here once again in The Finals because of their whole team.  So nothing has really changed.\r\nThey're a team that's had another year under their belt, and they've exceeded what they did last year.  So it's kind of hard to answer that question because it's not really true.\nQ. What's happened with our bench?  Your bench combined scored 10 points and J.R. scored three points?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: What happened?  They scored 45 points, we scored 10.  That's what happened.\nQ. Joe touched on it earlier, you've been in this position before already.  Curious to some of your guys, the other guys.  This is a loss in Game 1.  This is The Finals.  A stage like that, this is a time where some younger players can possibly get overwhelmed.  What have you seen from the other guys?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, I think they look forward to seeing what we can do better tomorrow in our film session and seeing ways we can get better going into Game 2.  Yeah, we've got some young guys, but as far as confidence in those guys not believing, that's never been the case for us or any of the guys in the locker room.\r\nI know they're excited.  We had a chance in that third quarter to do something special, but we didn't counter and do it.  Didn't make it happen in the fourth quarter.\r\nSo I'm looking forward to seeing the film session and seeing ways we can get better going into Game 2, and I think our team will as well.\nQ. You guys had 17 assists in this game tonight.  Were you happy with the flow of the offense?  It seemed like you and Kyrie a lot of times were taking it upon yourself to try to score?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: At times I was and at times I wasn't.  We've definitely got to do a better job getting the ball moving side-to-side, getting their bodies moving.  They're a great team.  When you have the ball on one side, they're able to load and do things of that nature.\r\nSo, you know, we will have a better game plan going into Game 2 for sure offensively.  Sometimes your offense dictates your defense, and the fact that we had 17 turnovers and that led to 25 points is not a good ingredient for our offense for sure.\nQ. We saw Iguodala strip Westbrook and Durant in the close of Game 6.  Tonight he got one on you, one on Kyrie.  Anything you can do knowing about his wingspan, his quickness, and his anticipation to prevent that?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, he's great at doing that, for sure.  Just got to do a better job protecting the ball.  It's that simple.\n",
  "Q. LeBron, Stephen was just asked about whether or not he cares about being the face of the league and supplanting LeBron James or not supplanting.  Where are you on that?  Do you care?  And is it something that means something to you to be thought of as the face of the league?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: First of all, I think what I care about is being fortunate to be a part of this league.  I have no sense of entitlement to be in this league.  This is a fraternity, and for me to even be a part of the 40-plus guys that we have in our league, I think it's an honor, and that's what I focus on.  I also focus on being a role model to the youth that looks up to me and what I'm able to do not only on the court but off the court.\r\nSo me having the power for our youth to see better light or whatever the case may be, that's what I love more than anything.  So if that comes with my name or whatever I do on a day-to-day basis that the youth get to see how it should be done or how to take advantage of any situation they're in, I'm okay with that.\nQ. I know you're versed in the history of the league and the rivalries that came before you.  What's it like for you to forge these new experiences?  You've had multiple Finals against Tim Duncan, for example, going against Steph Curry this time again.  What's it like to be in the middle of this?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I think it's great.  It's great for our game.  It's great for you as an individual, just the competitive side of it, to be able to face greats along your path is something that you're going to wish you could get back when you're done playing.\r\nLike you said, I've been fortunate to go against Duncan, and K.G. and Ray Allen and the great Piston team.  Now Steph, the great Steph and the Warriors team.  So I've been fortunate.  I don't want to leave out Dirk, as well.  I faced Dirk in The Finals and faced K.D. and Russ.  So I've been very fortunate to go against some of the greatest players in their era, in my era, and we'll see after the era when I'm done.\nQ. On Friday you spoke a lot about this newfound appreciation you have this postseason for what you've been able to accomplish.  For most people getting to that new mindset is the result of specific events or conversations or just thoughts.  I'm just wondering what prompted you specifically this off-season to get to this new mindset.\r\nLEBRON JAMES: It's not a new mindset.  I think people are taking it a little further than where it should be.  Something just -- it was a feeling I was after we won in Game 6 in Toronto, and that's how I was feeling at that moment.  I'm back to my usual self.\nQ. No longer thankful?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I'm no longer appreciating what I've been able to do (laughing).\nQ. A quick funny one, have you ever taken an Uber?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I have, but I don't have an account.\nQ. The real one here is a couple weeks ago you were talking about the MVP, and a bunch of us in this room and across the country took it as though you were slighting Steph, and Steph replied and it made for all sorts of headlines.  But beyond that, is there some sort of tension now or rivalry there between you two just because last year you were in The Finals and you're here again?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: First of all, I made the mistake by even answering the question because I knew where it was going to go, and I guarantee how it was phrased to Steph wasn't how I answered the question.  So obviously his reaction was what it was.  And I've been there before as well.  So Steph was definitely the MVP of our league and is the MVP in our league and is a great basketball player, and what he does for this league is amazing.\r\nThen the question was asked if I had a vote what would the difference be between most valuable and MVP, and I gave my opinion.  So obviously you guys ran with it.\r\nBut I don't know.  You guys make rivals.  I mean, I think it's great for the sport.  It's great for all sports.  I don't think me and Steph -- when you talk about rivalries, you talk about Carolina-Duke, you talk about Ohio State-Michigan.  It's hard to say LeBron and Steph.  If there's a smaller scale or another word for a rival.\r\nThe fact that we're going back-to-back I think is pretty unique.  It's pretty unique to be in this position and just to have another opportunity, another opportunity for guys to write about it, for us to play it, for the people to talk about it throughout the world.  I'm blessed that I can be a part of conversations.\nQ. LeBron, we often see in boxing a boxer looking forward to a rematch against the boxer who he lost to.  Did it matter who you were facing in The Finals?  Did you want the rematch against the Warriors, or were you just as happy and satisfied if you were taking on the Thunder?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: It didn't matter for us.  It's too hard for us to kind of -- throughout our postseason run we can't -- we weren't looking over on the West side seeing what was going on as far as who we'd like to play, because that would have been slighting our competition and who we were going against from Detroit to Atlanta to Toronto.\r\nIt was just we were focusing on our job and if we were fortunate enough to win four games in the first series, four games in the second series, and four in the Conference Finals, then whoever our next opponent was going to be we were going to be well prepared for.  So it didn't matter for sure.\nQ. Talking like Jay said, you appreciate history.  Andy Varejao is the first player to be traded from one team in the middle of the season and then play for the opposing team in the NBA Finals.  With that context to it and you in the past have called him one of your favorite teammates you've suited up with, what do you think about the fact that you'll be going up against him with the title on the line?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I think good things happen to good people.  So either way he would have been part of The Finals.  He's done so much in his career.  He's sacrificed a lot.  For him to be in this position I think is great for him, for his family.  No matter what has happened, he would have been here anyways.\nQ. When you return to Cleveland there is the idea of obviously trying to bring a championship to Cleveland to the Cavaliers.  How have you been able to minimize what a lot of people think is an immense amount of pressure?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't really get involved into the whole pressure thing.  I think I've exceeded expectations in my life as a professional.  I'm a statistic that was supposed to go the other way, growing up in the inner city, having a single-parent household.  It was just me and my mother.  So everything I've done has been a success.  So as far as the game of basketball, I just go out and play it and have fun and love it, and be true to the game and to my teammates and live with the results.  So I don't -- doesn't really get to me too much.\nQ. Following up on the question about Andy, how would you characterize, given his corporate knowledge of the Cleveland Cavaliers, your level of concern about his knowledge playing a role in this series?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Well, we're a totally different team than when he left.\nQ. Secondly, no matter how the series turns out, should he earn a ring either way?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I mean, that's not for me to debate.  For me, I'm just trying to put our team in the best position to win Game 1 and to move on to the next game.  But I haven't even -- I can't even go that far down the line right now.\nQ. At the end of the regular season you were talking about you have to shift into the Playoffs mode.  Do you have a Finals mode, and what is that?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: No, I think it's all part of it.  It's not another mode that I get into.  It's all part of the mindset and the commitment to what needs to be done to get the job done.  Sometimes you're very successful, sometimes you come close.  But I prepare myself mentally and physically for whatever that needs to be done, and I live with the results.\nQ. LeBron, can you rate or rank the teams you've played on going into The Finals as far as health and playing the right way at the right time?  How do you feel going into The Finals with some of the other teams?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: It would be hard for me to rank it right now.  I've been fortunate to be a part of seven Finals appearances, and every team that I've been on gave everything that we had.  Some we fell short and some we've been able to get over the mountaintop.  But not one team -- or one team didn't work harder than the next team.  It's too hard to get to this point.  It's too hard to get to this point to pick one team over the next, how much commitment that you've got to give to every day for you to even be a part of The Finals.\r\nAnd people look at my situation and kind of take it for granted seeing I've been here six straight times and they think it's easy, when it's not.\r\nEvery team that I've been on has given everything they had just to get to that point.  So I'm fortunate to be here again.\nQ. You mentioned that when Andy left, the team now is completely different.  Could you give a brief explanation how different is the team offensively and defensively since he left?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: Just a different team.\nQ. Some media released predictions which said Cavs have just a low percent chance to win the Championship.  What is your reaction to this?  Do you think the Cavs are the underdog?\r\nLEBRON JAMES: I don't get involved in that.  I really don't.  I don't get involved in predictions or the chances of this, chances of that.  Just got to go out and play the game between the four lines and 94 feet.  That's the only thing I focus on.\n",
  "Q.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, how would you characterize this season overall for the whole organization? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean, we had many chapters.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had many chapters in the season.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, for me, it's never a success if you go out losing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I think we put ourselves back where this franchise needs to be, being a contender.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But we've still got a lot of work to do.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you guys stated throughout these playoffs next man up, no excuses.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But now that it's over, how devastating of a blow was it to lose Kevin early in the playoffs, and then Kyrie in these Finals? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I think you even go before that, losing Andy, one of our heartbeats of our team, another playmaker for our team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Then you lose Kev, an All\u2011Star, and then you lose Kyrie, another All\u2011Star. \r\nTried as much as we could to try to make up for those guys, but it's a lot of talent sitting in suits.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've had a lot of playoff runs, been on both ends, and I know one thing that you've got to have during the playoff run, you've got to be healthy.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've got to be healthy.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've got to be playing great at the right time.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've got to have a little luck.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And we were playing great, but we had no luck and we weren't healthy.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There's all kinds of basketball stuff we could discuss.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But this marks the end of year one in your return to Cleveland.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Off the court, coming back home to friends, fans, family, has it been everything that you thought it would be when you made the decision to return? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 My family is happy.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That makes my job a lot easier.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For the fans, I go out and try to just leave it all on the floor and hope it's enough.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, I know, obviously, you have reason to be frustrated.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Sitting at the locker like you were just really dejected.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you talk about how this feeling feels compared to other times where you probably might have been bounced off the playoffs and just your emotion and dealing with that? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There's not much you can say really.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, you get to this point, and I've been on the short end of this four times, and I've been able to win it twice.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's really no great feeling when you lose. \r\nOnly thing you can do is just try to pick yourself back up whenever that time may be and then just go at it again.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm a guy who is just trying to be successful in whatever I do, and I give everything to my teammates, give everything to the coaching staff. \r\nWhen you fall short, it hurts and it eats at you, and it hurts me to know that I wish I could have done better and done more and just put a little bit more effort or whatever the case may be to help us get over the hump.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But it just wasn't our time.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you lose on a stage like this, how fast do you begin thinking about next season? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I haven't thought about next season at all.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, with all the things you're talking about, Kyrie, Kevin, that you were dealing with, was there ever a point in this Finals that you doubted whether you'd be able to pull this off? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah, when the numbers went to zero and we lost tonight.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's when I doubted.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's when it was over.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, obviously, I knew it was going to be a tough task, and I continued to tell you guys we were undermanned.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know any other team\u2011\u2011 I've been watching basketball for a long time.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm an historian of the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know any other team that's gotten to The Finals without two All\u2011Stars.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I cannot remember thinking of it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I can't remember in the back\u2011\u2011 I don't even know if it's ever happened, for a team to lose two All\u2011Stars and still be able to make it to The Finals. \r\nEven what Andy brings to our team as well, that's another double\u2011double guy.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had three playmakers in suits this round and even throughout the playoffs.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've got to have all the playmakers.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've got to be healthy.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've got to be at full strength to win it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We weren't.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We just wasn't.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The way you had to play in this series was so out of character for you in terms of how you like to play.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Did any part of you enjoy doing that, enjoy being able to do that?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Or do you prefer what's more comfortable to you? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean, I enjoy the competition.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And whatever it takes throughout the competition I'm fine with.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't enjoy being as non\u2011efficient as I was.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't enjoy that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't enjoy dribbling the ball for countless seconds on the shot clock and the team looking at me to make a play.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had 14 assists tonight.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I had nine of them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I did not enjoy that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's not winning basketball. \r\nLike I said, we had two big\u2011time playmakers on the sideline.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've got another one that's been out since early in the season.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And it was what I had to do. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0It was what was needed.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If I could have gave more, I would have done it, but I gave everything I had.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Did you at any point feel the series shift?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And if you felt that shift, were you concerned at the time that there wouldn't be an adjustment that the Cavs can make? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I felt\u2011\u2011 I mean, it was a great series up until\u2011\u2011 they blew the game open in the fourth in Game 5, but we had a chance there.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Tonight we had our chances, but, you know, we ran out of talent.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We ran out of talent tonight.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We gave everything we had.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The guys played as hard as they could as long as we could. \r\nBut that team across the way, you tip your hats to them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I cannot remember a team like them being healthy all year for the most part.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 All the guys, I mean, they did a great job.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Guys being healthy, guys playing their system, and it showed in these Finals.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, we learned a little bit more about your, I guess, training regimen throughout the course of these playoffs.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Basically it's a two\u2011month process you go through with mental and physical preparation.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you don't get the championship, is there any sense of\u2011\u2011 do you question whether it's all worth it?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Or can you just have satisfaction in the process? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, of course you question it, especially when you get to this point.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I always look at it would I rather not make the playoffs or lose in The Finals?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've missed the playoffs twice.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I lost in The Finals four times.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm almost starting to be like I'd rather not even make the playoffs than to lose in The Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It would hurt a lot easier if I just didn't make the playoffs and I didn't have a shot at it. \r\nBut then I lock back in and I start thinking about how fun it is to compete during the playoffs and the first round, the second round, and Eastern Conference Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If I'm lucky enough to get here again, it will be fun to do it. \r\nBut put my body through a lot, you know, but it's the price for your body feeling this way for winning.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Did I win?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I didn't win a championship, but I've done a lot of good things in this first year back, and hopefully I can continue it.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 First of all, congrats on the season.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Secondly, would you say that this is the most disappointing of the four losses in The Finals? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 All four of them are disappointing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's not one that's higher or lower or in the middle.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You don't win, it's disappointing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's not just one is bigger than the other.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I meant because of the comeback, the fact that you came back here and decided to make it your home again? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, you lose in The Finals, they're all disappointing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Doesn't matter if I'm playing in Miami or playing in Cleveland or playing on Mars.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You lose The Finals, it's disappointing.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, everybody on the Warriors agreed that defending you was the toughest job in basketball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What was your impression of what kind of job Andre Iguodala did, and what was his effect on the series? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I think the last couple games he played well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He played great, especially offensively.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He made us defend him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He knocked down open shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Defensively, it's never a one\u2011on\u2011one battle.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Guys get caught up in this whole one\u2011on\u2011one thing, and it's never a one\u2011on\u2011one battle.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Every time I'd get past him, another guy would step up, Draymond Green or whatever the case may be. \r\nIt's never one\u2011on\u2011one.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's not\u2011\u2011 this isn't Bird versus Magic or that old video game, Jordan versus Bird, or whatever the case may be.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There's no one\u2011on\u2011one.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I think his ability to play multiple positions for their team along with some of those other guys allowed their team to be so dynamic. \r\nHe made us pay.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He made us pay tonight with big shots, timely shots, getting out on the break, getting rebounds, getting assists.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He was pretty good for their team. \n\n",
  "Q.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, there was a play in the stretch you guys\u2011\u2011 the Warriors were at the charity stripe, they got a couple offensive rebounds at that point.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I remember you motioned over and it seemed like you asked to get a big in that situation.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you talk about how difficult that was for you guys to play small and those offensive rebound? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, I mean, at the end of the day no matter who is on the floor, we have to come up with that rebound.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's what it is.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We just have to come up with the rebound no matter if Double T or Mozzy are not in the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've got to come up with those rebounds.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That just can't happen at the free\u2011throw line.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 J.R. got off to a good start.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think he had four of his first seven threes there and then he went quiet again.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What do you think happened with him?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Was that just the game kind of flowed away from him, or what did you see happen with him? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know what happened with him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, we kept going to him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He just missed some shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He came out aggressive, which we wanted him to do.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We kept finding him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He started off well, he just cooled down.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's just a make\u2011or\u2011miss league. \r\nHe took some great shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Some of them was in a rhythm, and some of them\u2011\u2011 after he hit a few, he loves to go to the heat check, and we're all okay with that, and he just missed them.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron and Tristan, LeBron, you gave, I would say, everything you had there, 40, 14, and 11, and you still come up short.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For both of you, how do you cope with that, when you have games like that that you guys usually win? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, you cope with it by understanding it's just one game and looking at the opportunity we have on Tuesday to force a Game 7.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously, for myself, I want to do whatever it takes to help our team win, and I haven't been able to do that the last two. \r\nSo hopefully I can do a better job coming in on Tuesday.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We all as a unit can do a better job, and we'll be fine. \r\nTRISTAN THOMPSON:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Piggyback on what LeBron said, just watch film and figure out areas we can do better at.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For me, rebound a little better, guard my man a little better, and just don't have mental breakdowns. \r\nBut like he said, we've got to go home and get a win and force a Game 7.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously, like you just said, you guys will be on the cusp of elimination on Tuesday.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But obviously you don't want the Warriors celebrating on your home floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So how do you rally your teammates, and what will be your message to them before Game 6? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, we don't want them celebrating at all, no matter if it's on our home floor or their home floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've come this far, and we've been very good at home.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We have to understand why we weren't good in Game 4.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had a lack of energy.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had a lack of effort in a lot of areas in Game 4, and we can't repeat that or they'll raise the trophy for sure.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron and Tristan, you guys had pretty much avoided a Stephen Curry explosion until tonight, and really kind of the fourth quarter, anything you guys could have done?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Or just talk about what it's like when he kind of heats up like that? \r\nTRISTAN THOMPSON:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's one of the best shooters in our league.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Coach preach to us every night, have a high hand, he's going to make tough shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He took a couple shots he made on me.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Couple tough threes.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But we've got to contest and we've got to be at half court and make it physical for him and make it tough for him. \r\nI guess your word, I guess he exploded, quote/unquote, but we've just got to do better.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's not just Delly, it's all of us.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've all got to help him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The bigs got to help him and just get it out of his hands.\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I thought he was great.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You tip your hat off to a guy like that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He made seven threes.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know, were any of them not contested, hand in his face, falling, stepback off the dribble?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm okay with that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're okay with that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, you tip your hat to a guy who makes shots like that, and he's the guy that can do it in our league.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's the best shooter in our league. \r\nBut that's not why we lost.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We gave up 18 fast breakpoints.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We gave up 15 second\u2011chance points.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Steph was special, obviously, but him hitting those stepback threes is not why we lost the game.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The fourth quarter has gone their way pretty well the last two games.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is it fatigue, the depth thing, or is it just execution problems?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What's going on in those last couple nights? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think tonight, obviously, Steph got it going.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He hit some huge shots which kept us at bay.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They got a couple of offensive rebounds that didn't work to our favor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, we needed our best defensive quarter tonight in the fourth quarter, and we didn't get it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We gave up 31 points in the fourth.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Some of them were free throws, but a lot of them were them just breaking us down.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So we've got to do a better job of that.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You said hopefully you can do a little more the next game out.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How much more can you possibly do given what you've been putting in in this series, and do you ever recall having to extend yourself this far in a series? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't put a ceiling on what I can do.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, tonight I gave up two offensive rebounds\u2011\u2011 one to Barbosa in the first half, one to Harrison Barnes, which allowed him to get an and\u2011one with Iguodala with the left\u2011hand trick shot. \r\nI had a couple turnovers, a couple miscues defensively, and I've got to be better.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Like I said, I don't put a ceiling on what I'm capable of doing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know I'm shouldering a lot of the burden, but it is what it is.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You seem to be playing a lot more comfortable this Finals series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There was a play I think you had a behind\u2011the\u2011back lay\u2011up where you went up and you're making crazy threes.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you feel a lot less pressure this Finals run just because you are undermanned and you had some injuries as opposed to previous years? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, I feel confident because I'm the best player in the world.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's that simple.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 In regards to pressure with the games playing, do you feel as if this Finals team, it's a little less? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, I mean, it's The Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's something you dream of when you're a kid.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For me, I put the work in.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I put the work in every single day, either when you guys are there, either when you're not there.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Some of our beat writers see me.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They know how much work I put into it, and I give everything to my teammates. \r\nWhen you're true to the game, it doesn't matter if it's a regular season game or a Finals game, you just go out and trust what you put into the game and you live with the results.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So shouldn't be crazy when I make threes, though.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's just a shot.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 In particular, the half court one, the almost half court one, that was somewhat crazy?\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Okay.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Would you agree?\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 All right (laughing).\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You mentioned giving up some offensive rebounds and the second\u2011chance points that they got as a team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You guys usually are doing that to other teams.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Was there any sort of a deflating feeling when they were able to keep coming up with those offensive rebounds? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you're going up against a high\u2011offensive\u2011power team like this, to get them to miss, it's very deflating when they get a second\u2011chance point or a second\u2011chance crack.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Even when they don't make it, they're looking for those three pointers, they're looking for Klay and Steph when they get offensive rebounds.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So those are very deflating. \r\nBut we've got to do a better job of hitting bodies, coming over the ball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They're going to get offensive rebounds because they shoot a lot of jump shots and a lot of long rebounds, but when that happens, we've got to match up very quickly and not allow them to make shots.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Tristan, what's it like being on the other end of that, because usually you're doing that to other teams? \r\nTRISTAN THOMPSON:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah, like LeBron said, it's definitely deflating to our defense.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But like he said, they take some tough shots that you don't see too often, so we've got to find our man, box him out.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If it's not the bigs grabbing rebounds, guards come, so we've just got to all collectively grab rebounds and push it back on them in transition.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, do you feel that at this moment of this series, this roster, the roster you guys have right now, do you remember like those Cavaliers X teams where you had to do it all but it wasn't enough, your previous Cavaliers teams? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Nope.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Nope we're going home with a Game 6, and we've got enough to win it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We protect home we come here.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We'll worry about Tuesday first.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But if we protect home like we're capable of doing, we force a Game 7.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So this is different? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I feel confident.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, do you feel like the smaller lineup hurt you guys defensively tonight?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The Golden State Warriors shot 48 percent against you guys?\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, there are a lot of things that hurt us tonight.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Steph being one of them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That had nothing to do with going small.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think we were much more active tonight than we were in Game 4. \r\nAnd some of the shots that they made, like I said, some of the shots that Steph made, you've got to tip your hat to a guy like that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, he's between, behind, crossover, stepback threes, with a contest, you're okay with that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That had nothing to do with us being small. \r\nWhen we don't get back in transition, those are things we can clean up.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When we get offensive rebounds on free throws, those are things we can clean up.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Those are things that can hurt you.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But it had nothing to do with us being small.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Whoever's in the game needs to do their job and do it at a high level, do it to the best of their ability and you live with the aftermath after that. \n\n",
  "Q.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You in The Finals, your team has seen the opposition make changes to the lineup.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 With Barea with Dallas in 2011, they put Diaw in last year in the starting lineup, and Iggy the other night, what is the adjustment period like for the opposition when a team that's been doing it one way and you've been scouting them one way makes that change late? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, it's an adjustment for sure.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's much more of an adjustment on the fly because you're not quite sure that a team is going to do that, so you've been preparing for a certain lineup and they're able to make the switch.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So it kind of makes the lineups and the preparation a little bit different for the guys that are covering him. \r\nIn this case with our big, Timo and Tristan, Timo's starting off on Iggy, it's a different match\u2011up than Bogut, obviously.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've got a guy that's primarily on the perimeter in Game 4 versus guarding a guy that's always in the paint, for the most part, unless he's initiating offense. \r\nSo it's definitely a different change for us.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I think we'll be much more prepared for it tomorrow night if they go with the same lineup.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Have you found that it's an adjustment that is quick once you've seen it once, or is it something that can linger for two or three games before you can pick it up? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean, it's not that quick.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously you don't have many games to allow it to linger, and hopefully you can get comfortable with it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I think our coaching staff, if we're not in tune with what's going on or we're not ready for the speed or the action, we'll be able to make the sub and make the proper adjustments in game instead of waiting for it after.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The numbers in this series are what they are.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 In the first three you averaged 41 points, you almost won all three games.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The other night 20, and you lost by 20 or whatever.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Are you in a spot now where you have to score huge numbers for this team to win? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I'm in a spot where I have to be very productive, and that's just the spot I've always been in.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For me, from the perception, it's a lose\u2011lose when it comes to, okay, well, in the first three games I score 40, but I shoot a lot of shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Last game I scored 20, I don't shoot as many shots, and we lose.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So it's like what do you want? \r\nSo for me that's not my\u2011\u2011 that's not my thought process.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't really care about it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 All I care about is how I can produce for our team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And if that's going out and trying to put up 40 or if it's putting up 35 shot attempts or if it's\u2011\u2011 at the time, if we can win by me taking 22 shots as well, then you just play the game and see how it can affect your team.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How much really does an extra day of rest help?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How much better do you feel after two days of rest when you've almost played 100 games this season? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, any little rest you can get throughout the postseason run, I mean, it's like a lifeline.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For us to be able to get this extra day to mentally and physically prepare for tomorrow night or tomorrow day is definitely helpful.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 In what stage of your career did weightlifting and strength become kind of an essential part of your game to where you can take some of the fouls, the non\u2011fouls that you take? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think in my fifth year, my fifth, sixth year when I started to have some back problems.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think a lot of it had to do with me not properly taking care of my body the right way. \r\nI came into the league at 18, so weightlifting at 18, 19, 20, 21 really didn't mean much to me.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I started to make the postseason.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I started making good runs, and I felt my body started to get tired during the postseason.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And I felt like it was time for me to do something to help my body not only be ready for the physical, but more the stress and the long haul of the season that it provided.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There's been guys who came into the league with you that are not in the league anymore from injuries or whatever.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So has it extended your career, you would say?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Has it made you a stronger player? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, everything that I've done has extended my career.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, I take\u2011\u2011 I really take care of my body to where if I even have a slight injury I'm able to come back a little bit faster than some maybe because it's what helped me get out on the floor every night. \r\nIt's very important to me.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 My diet and how I eat is very important to me.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How much I lift and how much I train is very important to me.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Then how much you allow the body to rest as well. \r\nObviously, it's not as much rest as you would like, but sometimes you have to just get off your feet as well, just to give your body time to recover.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So I found a great balance where I know what my body can take, I know what it can't take and get me trying to play at a high level.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know the shots didn't fall the other night from the perimeter.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But were you guys happy with the shots that you got, though? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yes and no.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think some of the shots that we got we were happy about, but some of them that we took we weren't happy about.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think we allowed their lineup to get us out of what we did in Games 1, 2, and 3, and that was control the pace and put the ball into the post.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We shot 27 threes. \r\nSo I would say half of those or even more than half were some good shots, but a few of them we wish we could have back.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you hear a lot of game momentum, momentum this and that?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you believe in momentum between games and who do you think has it? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean, it depends on the situation.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It depends on how the game was played.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It depends on the two teams.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think when you get to a championship level\u2011type game with it being 2\u20112, I don't think anyone has the momentum.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously, everyone would say them because they're coming back home and then after the game they had the other night, but the momentum starts once the game starts. \r\nWe'll see who can put the most possessions together, who can make the most plays and put themselves and their team in a position to win.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 J.R. just mentioned over there that the good thing for him is he feels he can't get any worse.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What is it about him that gives you the confidence that he can and will respond? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I think the main thing with J.R. and for me as a leader, I don't care how many shots he missed.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't want his head to be down like it was in Game 4.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's a make or miss league.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 J.R. practices enough.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We all are all professional athletes and we practice on our craft.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But you can never allow someone either from the media or from the fans, from the opposition, from your family to ever see that you're down about what you're doing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It doesn't matter.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He has to stay confident. \r\nHe can miss a hundred shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If they're great looks, they're drive\u2011and\u2011kicks, you shoot them with confidence.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If he's feeling confident about his ability, then I'm confident about it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But once\u2011\u2011 as a competitor, once you lose confidence in yourself, then it's really not much coming back from that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So if he's confident in himself, he'll be fine.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They played the small ball last game to win the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How do you adjust to it? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean, they started small ball, but they've played a lot of small ball all year.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's the luxury that Coach Kerr has with the type of personnel that he has where he's able to slide Draymond Green to the five and play small.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's a luxury of having a guy like Draymond and having that type of personnel where he can play that type of basketball and still be effective. \r\nWe're going to play our game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've gotten to this point by playing the way we play, and we're not going to change.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We'll make adjustments throughout the game, but we won't change our starting lineup. \n\n",
  "Q.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've talked all series about being undermanned and overmatched.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So tonight Golden State comes out.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They make an adjustment with their starting lineup.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They feel like they've changed the pace.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Are you, as a team, in a position where you can make an adjustment, or are you confined to just go with what you have?\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We don't have many options as far as lineups we can go to, but we can make adjustments.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's what you do throughout a series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We'll get to the film and make the necessary adjustments coming into Game 5.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But as far as lineup changes, we don't have many different lineup changes we can actually go to.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you went down and hit your head, one, how are you feeling now?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Two, did you think that you'd have to go through any sort of concussion test or anything like that at the time? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I was just trying to regain my composure, and I was holding my head.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It was hurting.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I was just hoping I wasn't bleeding.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But obviously the camera cut me pretty bad.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Our medical staff did a great job of stopping the bleeding. \r\nI knew I had to shoot the free throws or I wasn't going to be able to come back into the game, so it didn't matter what was going on with my head at that point in time.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I had to go up there and shoot those free throws so I could continue to play.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you mentioned you guys don't have a lot of lineups you can go to right now.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But when a guy like J.R. Smith is struggling how he is, how difficult\u2011\u2011 how much pressure does that put on everybody else?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And what can you do or what can you say to try to help him through this? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't put too much pressure on anyone else.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You continue to stick with them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We all struggle at times.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We all have a couple games here, a couple games there we won't play so well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We know we can help the team, but just not falling for us. \r\nBut you don't give up on anyone.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We all got to this point together, and you stick with them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's been huge for our team all year.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We wouldn't be at this point without him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So hopefully he can get it going, which we believe.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 In the fourth quarter after you guys had cut that 12\u2011point halftime deficit down to six, you're out of the game for the first couple minutes and they put you back to double digits.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What goes through your mind there?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you feel like you can't even come out of the game? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Oh, well, I was hoping our team could buy me a few minutes.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I ran through those 12 minutes in the third, and I gassed out.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just tried to put us in a position\u2011\u2011 Steph hit a big\u2011time three at the end of the third, put them up six, I missed one, but I was pretty much gassed either from driving, creating opportunities for my teammates, getting to the free\u2011throw line, getting offensive glass, just trying to make that push. \r\nAnd I was hoping our team could just buy me a couple minutes.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We weren't able to do that tonight in the fourth quarter, and, I mean, it's difficult.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You want to be out there, but also you don't want to be\u2011\u2011 you want to be effective while you're out there too.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So they made a huge run, and we just couldn't regather after that.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just to follow up on that, the coach talked about how he felt maybe the schedule was really starting to fatigue the side.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you talk to that?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And also I've got to ask you specifically about the man earlier in the week, Delly, do you think his hospital visit had an impact on his performance tonight? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, I mean, no excuses.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The schedule is what it is.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We knew that coming into the series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We knew it was going to be every other day when we got home, and those guys were going to have two days in between when they went home.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I think defensively we were still very good.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Offensively we were terrible.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You can't always\u2011\u2011 you can't always bank on your offense.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes your offense just doesn't show up, and there is no way we go 4\u2011for\u201127 from the three\u2011point line and expect to win. \r\nWe outrebounded them still.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had 16 offensive rebounds.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had 20 second\u2011chance points.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But we just couldn't get the long ball going tonight, and that definitely hurt\u2011\u2011 our offense hurt us just as bad as anything. \r\nAs far as Delly, I think Delly said he felt great.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We thought he was great.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He just didn't make shots, and that's what happens sometimes.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, they talk about you getting stitches or anything like that?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is that a possibility?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Two, do you think you guys are going to have to go deeper on the bench and play more guys just to\u2011\u2011 you guys kind of looked like your legs were heavy tonight. \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I already got the stitches.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously, you can't see them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's the coach's decision if he decides he wants to go deeper in the bench.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We haven't played many guys throughout this playoff run.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think it would help some of the guys that are playing some high minutes for sure.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just give guys a couple minutes here, a couple minutes there.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I think the coaching staff will try to do what's best to help us be physically and mentally prepared for Sunday.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How many stitches? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Enough to close it up.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Steve Kerr said Iguodala has been his best player in this series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 This was the first game he started all season long.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What did you think his impact was tonight? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's one of the X\u2011factors, and he came to play.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He shot the ball extremely well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He hit four threes.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He was in attack.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He got a couple dunks in transition early on in the game which got him going, and he was really good for them. \r\nCoach Kerr did a great job of mixing the lineup up.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They have so many different interchangeable players where he can kind of decide how he wants to go with his lineups in that nature, and to start him tonight gave them that boost.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Did you feel like they did anything differently defensively against you or was it mostly straight up still, or did they shade guys toward you as you got in the lane? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, they doubled me a little bit more tonight.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They kind of made me get a ball up, seeing if some of my teammates can beat those guys. \r\nLike I said, we couldn't make any shots from the outside, but we'll take those looks again.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Those guys, my guys did a great job just stepping into them, trying to make them being confident about them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But when you go 4\u2011for\u201127 from the three\u2011point line, there's not much success offensively.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They talked a lot about trying to increase the pace the past few days.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you think there was anything they were effective in doing that or, again, is that a product of you guys not making shots and allowing them to get out? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah, their pace has been pretty good all series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's just that we've made shots and we've made them take the ball out of the basket instead of getting it off a rebound.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Tonight we shot 33 percent from the field.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So when you're getting the ball off the glass or you're getting the ball off the rim, your pace is much better than when you're taking the ball off the net.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So it's just a product of us not shooting the ball well at all.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 J.R. Smith has really been struggling throughout this whole series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Today, 0\u2011from\u20118 from the three\u2011point line.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you think maybe bringing him back to the starting five will be the right step to build up his confidence? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's a decision I think Coach Blatt and the coaching staff will either make or not make.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's been great for us coming off the bench.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's been great for us starting.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So we'll see.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We'll see what the coaches have him playing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're going to go with him, we'll continue to give him the ball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's a spark for our team, whether he's in the starting role or not.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Your fans started to leave the arena five minutes before the game was over.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Your comment about that? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't have any comment about it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, I came out of the game as well early.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So we were on the same page.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 At the start of the game they took out Andrew Bogut and went with Iguodala in the starting lineup.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What kind of challenges does their small ball lineup present to you guys? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, obviously, you're going to have a lot of guys on the perimeter.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When your big is accustomed to guarding a big for three straight games and there is a change, now our big, meaning Timo, has to make a change.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He has to guard a smaller guy, which he's not been accustomed to ever.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So he definitely gave us a little different look defensively to start the game. \r\nWe still started the game pretty well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We were up 7\u20110, but Steph making the three, Iguodala hits the three, Harrison Barnes makes one, Draymond hits one.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And they offensively got it going.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They got in a rhythm, and you could start seeing it. \r\nIt's something like I said, while it's going on, you kind of like:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What do we do here?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What do we do there?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And that's what the days in between games are for.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You're able to look at the film and go from there and see ways you can just be better.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Three games left.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How are you going to be able to overcome the utter physical and mental exhaustion that you're feeling? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, it's three games left possibly.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You just go out and play.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know you go out, you play hard. \r\nCoaching staff gives you a great game plan, you go out and execute it and live with the results at the end of the day. \r\nThat's all you can ask.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's the biggest stage in the world, but I don't put too much added pressure on myself about basketball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's just\u2011\u2011 that's all it is.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's just basketball.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Two questions.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 One, did you have to go through any concussion protocol things?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Was there any thought that you might have something like that?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And the second one would be you guys are two games away from winning a title.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just living here, feeling that in the city of Cleveland, what's that been like for you the last couple of days? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, I didn't have to go through any concussion protocol.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I had a slight headache, which I think every last one of you guys would probably have if you ran into a camera.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You might have a little bit more than that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I didn't go through any protocol.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm fine.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Like I said, I got a few stitches and I got a little slight headache right now, but I'll be fine with that. \r\nI don't know if I get the feeling or not, because I don't really get involved in it, the whole thing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I understand how important this city is and what I mean to this city and what our team means to the city as far as even with other professional sports teams that we have in this city, but I don't get caught up into it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just go out and play my game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I try to lead the best way I can, and if I can put my team and this franchise in a position to win the title, I'm grateful for that, and that's what I'm trying to do.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Draymond Green was just in here and he said this Finals has been a street fight.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So to use a boxing analogy, you guys are moving into the championship rounds.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You have a lot of Finals experience; a lot of your teammates do not.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 As a leader, how do you keep their confidence up for these last three games for this fight? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean, if I told my teammates six months ago or whatever the case may be that it would be 2\u20112 and we had an opportunity to be 2\u20112 in The Finals going on the road, would you take it?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 With three games left, I think all of them would accept that, and that's what it's about. \r\nI mean, this is the biggest stage.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's being covered by everyone in the world, and you should just be happy to go out and just compete.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Win, lose or draw, you go out and compete.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And that's all that should matter. \r\nIt shouldn't matter what everyone is talking about or what everyone is putting pressure on you or things of that nature.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It means nothing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, in the scheme of things.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You go out and you play, and you've been playing basketball your whole life.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You live with the results after that.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The series is tied now going to Golden State.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you feel that this is the biggest challenge of your career so far?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How do you feel about maybe thinking about letting this one go at home? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You don't let any of them go.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Both teams are in The Finals for a reason.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You can either look at it, okay, we stole home court and they stole it back.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Or you could look at it and say they won two on their floor; we won two on our floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It would be the same thing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If they won Game 1 and Game 2 and we came home and protected home court, it would be 2\u20112 and we're heading to Game 5. \r\nSo the story line is different.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It just depends on what day it is and how you guys want to write the story. \r\nBiggest challenge of my career was being down 3\u20112 going into Boston.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's probably the biggest challenge of my career.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Game 5 at Golden State is not that big when it comes to going to Boston and you lose multiple times in that arena, and the franchise that I was with at the time had never won a playoff game in Boston.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Now that's pretty challenging.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So I've been through a little bit in my pretty cool career. \n\n",
  "Q.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Are you able to describe how much will and determination factor into winning? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's really hard to describe.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You just try to give everything that you have to your teammates and live with the results.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, for me, I just try to put it all on the line to a point where win, lose or draw, you're satisfied with the outcome.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 One a little bit out of left field.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You're known as King James.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The Australian government has the power to knight citizens of our country.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Would you endorse Sir Dellavedova? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 (Laughing).\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's pretty cool.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Whatever is in the favor of good for Delly, I'm all for it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So whatever that guy wants or needs, I'm all for.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We'll take that as a yes. \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Could you describe just what this reunion has been like with the fans in Cleveland, considering the emotion was probably on the sour side when you left, and the way they've welcomed you, did you have any concern with how they'd embrace you once you got back? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think time heals all.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It was a bitter moment when I left the first time, but it's a sweet moment here now that I'm back.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Both sides had an opportunity to kind of miss each other, and they say if it's worth having and it's supposed to be there, then it will always come back. \r\nThat's the example it is today, and I'm happy to be back.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know the fans are excited and exuberant about me being back.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Not only just about me, this team, putting this team back in the position where they can compete and have something to talk about from our side, the basketball side.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And it's been pretty cool so far.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Toughness, the word toughness in sports can mean so many different things.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What does it mean to you, and how does your definition of it relate to this team? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, like you said, it could have so many different meanings from physical toughness to mental toughness, spiritual toughness.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You have to be put in so many different examples and so many different forms and able to see the tough when it comes out. \r\nI think from our team, we have a little bit of it all.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just the adversity that we faced not only in the postseason but all season.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The toughness as far as physical, the injuries that we faced. \r\nThe ups and downs that we've had throughout the season, being 19 and 20 at one point.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Now to making the trade and having to go through another tough transition, to our All\u2011Star forward being out for the season.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Now to our All\u2011Star point guard being out for the season, and that's being able to still stay at bay. \r\nIt shows so many different forms of toughness that we've had throughout the season, and especially in the postseason.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's obvious the physical toll that this is taking on you.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How mentally taxing is this?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm not sure we've ever seen you have to be so laser focused and calculating during games. \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You say how much it's taken out of me.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I want it to take it all.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Then after the game I'm able to kind of decompress for a little bit. \r\nObviously I'm not getting much sleep.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You guys can see I'm not getting much sleep right now, but I'm okay with that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm okay with not sleeping to be able to prepare myself and mentally keep myself intact on what's the main objective for me right now, and that is to make sure that my guys are laser sharp, get myself mentally prepared, physically prepared to go out and battle. \r\nIt's been a difficult challenge, a tough challenge, but I knew that. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0Being the sole leader of a team and a franchise, it's taxing, but I accept the challenge.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I accept it all, and I'm okay with it.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Could you talk a little bit about Delly, a follow\u2011up on kind of the junkyard dog attitude he brings to this team? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, Delly comes from a rugby background.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And if any of you guys ever have an opportunity to ever watch a rugby game, you see how tough it is, and that's what it's about.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He just\u2011\u2011 he brings it all.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Everything that he has, he lays out on the floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think he dove on the ground last night, an NBA Finals record, six times (laughing).\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Last night, and last night he was on the ground again after the game in the hospital, so you could probably say seven times. \r\nHe gives us everything that he has, and we all appreciate it as his brothers in the lineup beside him.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm sure you're aware of the historic performances in The Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Does it feel like something legendary is happening on the court, or is that something you'll be able to put in perspective when the series is over? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I truly don't feel it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't go home and turn on the TV and watch highlights and watch the coverage of the games.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I went home last night and I turned on \"Chopped.\"\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I watched \"Chopped\" last night and then \"Teen Titans\" after that at 2:30 in the morning. \r\nSo I don't really know what's going on.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know we're up 2\u20111.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know our team is fighting for our lives.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're undermanned.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're undermatched, and we're fighting.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's all I know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Me and my brother Maverick, we always talk and say that at some point probably when I'm done we'll sit back and gather a lot of my playoff games, get a couple bottles of wine and enjoy it and watch it and say okay, those were some special times.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But right now I don't feel it.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I haven't seen it yet, but a lot of people reading about it online last night, liked your segment with Dwyane Wade.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How would you assess his ability on our side of the room, and did he get the secret motivation?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Did he find out the answer? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, first of all, it's great to always see him and be alongside him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No matter if it's in a uniform or he's in a suit and I'm in street clothes.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I thought he was great.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously our chemistry is great.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously you guys knew you all could lull me in with him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You guys used D Wade to get me there.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Which is cool.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I understand that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know. \r\nAnd he tried to get the secret motivation out of me, and I didn't give it to him either, even though I told him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But he won't tell you guys, though.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He won't tell you all until hopefully after this is all over. \n\n",
  "Q.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 In the last minutes of the game you came up with a couple steals from Steph.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 One was off an inbounds play, and after that steal you started pointing at your head, maybe at your temple a little bit.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What was going on with that? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, I just seen them run that set before, and I was telling the coaching staff that I was in tune and I knew it was coming.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 During this postseason you've had multiple guys step up aside of you and play well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Tonight it was the dynamic duo of you and Dellavedova.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you look at what you guys were able to accomplish out there, was there a time on the court where you knew that you two guys had it going? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean, I know one thing I'm going to count on Delly as always is how hard he's going to play.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's going to give everything he's got.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 His body, he's going to throw his body all over the place.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And he's going to compete at a high level however many minutes he's out on the floor. \r\nTonight it was 30 1/2 minutes, and for 30 1/2 minutes he gave everything he's got.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It was great to have someone like that out on the floor that was willing to sacrifice everything for the better of the team.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Could you talk a little bit about your teammates accepting their roles and their defensive intensity for this game?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 A lot of people are equating it to like the Allen Iverson, 76ers team that went to The Finals where you're handling the bulk of the scoring, but they're really locking down defensively knowing their roles and helping you out in a great way. \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, we said it from the beginning that in order for us to win, we have to defend.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 My guys do a great job of coming out and defending.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Everyone knows their role, and we all play our role to the best of our ability.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We don't step outside our box.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you have that type of chemistry out on the floor, it makes everything work.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The other day you didn't like the suggestion that they were letting you get 40\u2011plus points.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Tonight Steph Curry was talking about how your 40 is not the problem, that it's just coming in with a high volume of shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm just curious your reaction to that comment? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't have a reaction.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm just trying to do whatever it takes to help our team win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If it's high\u2011volume shooting, if it's high rebounding, if it's high assists, whatever it takes to help our team win. \r\nWe're out two All\u2011Stars, and we're out a starting center, so I have to pick up some of the shot attempts.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm not a high\u2011volume guy.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't like to shoot high\u2011volume shots, but it's The Finals, and it's whatever it takes. \r\nI don't have a comment for Steph.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's not my concern.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What my concern is how I come out and play, be aggressive.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If it's high\u2011volume shooting, I'm living in the paint.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'll shoot 34 shots, but I only took six threes, and one of them was a heave at the end of a shot clock.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That lets me know I'm being aggressive.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 After Game 2, LeBron, you challenged the Cleveland crowd to come out here and match the intensity that you saw in Oakland in Games 1 and 2.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How do you think the crowd helped out today?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Did it help motivate you guys?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously you came out with big intensity. \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Absolutely.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They were unbelievable from the start to the finish.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We fed off them, and we just tried to give it all back to them for 48 minutes.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 As loud as they were, they need to go home now and start soaking up a lot of tea, drinking a lot of tea for the next 36 hours, whatever the case may be, because they need to be just as loud Thursday night. \r\nSo I need you guys to get those voices right.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But they're going to be unbelievable Thursday night as well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Those guys, everyone, they were amazing.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Back to what you were talking about.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The efficiency is something that's one of the few ways where you'll consistently critique your own game even in a win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Did you have to go through some sort of mind shift to kind of allow yourself to be okay with playing this way or get yourself to the point of playing this way? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, I'm not okay with it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm not okay with it, but I'm so outside the box right now.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I went seven straight seasons with improving my efficiency.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Seven straight into this year, the previous seven seasons, seven straight seasons with improving my efficiency as far as shooting. \r\nBut this is a different challenge.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 This is a totally different challenge.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've never played where two All\u2011Stars were out.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So it's a different challenge for myself, and it's outside the box, but it's not too far.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's not far for me to go grab.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm just trying to do whatever it takes to help.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know you guys keep hearing me elaborate on whatever it takes, but that's what I'm trying to do. \r\nI'm high\u2011volume shooting, but it's not like I'm going out there and I'm high\u2011volume shooting and I'm not doing anything else.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm doing everything for our team to help our team win, and that's all that matters.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Steve Kerr said that it felt like his team lacked life those first three quarters.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you were out there during those first three quarters, did you get the sense that it was you guys sucking the life out of them? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, I mean, I don't think those guys lacked life.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think they came in and we just tried to put pressure on them like we've done the first three games, the first two games and then tonight. \r\nBut those guys, they got a rhythm in the fourth quarter.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Part of it is because we allowed them to get into a rhythm in the start of the fourth.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had some costly turnovers as well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We let Steph shake three, but some of Steph's threes were some he made in the fourth quarter, were some of the same he missed in Game 2 or earlier in the game tonight.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had some heck of a contest, but he was just \u2011\u2011 he let them go. \r\nBut for us we've just got to continue to put the pressure on them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Try to keep them below their averages.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They're going to make great shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They're a great team, great players, great coaching staff.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We'll just live with the results.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, what you guys were able to do defensively to them, in the third quarter they only had 55 points.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It seemed like you kind of took the wind out of their sails a little bit.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Was that satisfying for you out on the floor seeing that you're almost able to break a team? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's not satisfying when they end the game with 91.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We hold them to 55 points for three quarters and we allowed them to break off with 36.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's not satisfying at all.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've got a lot of film to watch tomorrow.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're a young group, and we have to learn from our mistakes.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had a lot of mistakes in the fourth quarter.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think everybody's going to remember the turnovers we had late.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But it started from the beginning.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We have to learn from those things. \r\nWe're a young group, and like I told the guys, it's okay.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's okay.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We haven't been in a lot of these situations, if any, with this group. \r\nBut the best teacher in life is experience.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We experienced it tonight.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're going to watch a lot of film tomorrow on ways we can get better, close out games the best way, and we'll be ready for Game 4.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you please elaborate on your working relationship with Coach Blatt?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Earlier this evening he said that he's not always know what you're going to do, but he's certain that you will do the right thing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So can you please give us your side of this relationship? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think our relationship continues to grow every day.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 To have a guy like that who has been around the game of basketball for so many years, he wants the best out of his team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He wants the best for himself as well and his coaching staff and to be able to be the leader of the team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just try to give it all back to him. \r\nMy mind is always working throughout the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes I'm able to say it verbally, sometimes I'm just thinking the game and hoping the coaching staff and players and the guys and Coach Blatt know whatever I'm doing, it's for the best of the team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And he's allowing me to do that, and I respect that a lot.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Given all the adversity that you guys have faced here in the postseason, when you see Shump go down, leave the game and then come back and play with what nearly looks like one arm, what's that show you? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We just can't afford any more injuries.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We just can't, especially from a guard perspective.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just thought about his shoulder.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 As soon as it happened, I knew exactly which shoulder it was, and I was just hoping for the best.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When he came back on the floor with his shoulder wrapped and knowing that he wasn't at a hundred percent, which is his body out there, and still competing, it means everything to the team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It means everything to me.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It means everything to him as well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 As you can tell, he came back out there. \r\nBut, yeah, we just can't afford any injuries right now.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're already depleted.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, is there a scarier opponent in the league than Steph when he gets going like that, especially at the end of a game?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And, two, is there any concern going forward that he's found his rhythm and he's kind of found his shooting stroke a little bit? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 A scarier opponent in our league?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, we have some very great basketball players in our league, and Steph happens to be one of them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 His ability to shoot the ball is probably\u2011\u2011 I've never seen someone that can shoot the ball off the dribble like himself, ever.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So he's always keeping you off balance.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Every game is different.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He caught a rhythm in the fourth quarter tonight and hit some big shots. \r\nBut for us we just try to continue to make it tough on him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's a great player.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's a league MVP, and that's all you can ask.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Our defense, we held this great team to 40 percent shooting.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's not just about one guy.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Even though he's going to get it going, we've just got to make sure we do a good number on the rest of those guys.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 In regard to that team defense, how much does it help during the playoffs that you've been able to dig into an opponent's tendencies in a series compared to the regular season where it's one game on to the next opponent? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, the regular season can never compare to a playoff game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just because we play so many games throughout the regular season, and you're going from city to city, players to players, different systems to different systems.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You don't have much time to really get into the books and get into the tendencies and things of that nature. \r\nIn the postseason you're able to kind of not get a rhythm, but know what's going to go on.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Because once the playoffs start, not many teams are going to change.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've worked so many months to work a system that that's what you're going to see. \r\nFor us, for our coaching staff to be able to put us in a position where we feel like this is best for us to win, as the players, we just try to go out and execute it the best way we can by playing hard, competing, making them take tough shots and also attacking them on the other end. \r\nThe playoffs is definitely a great way to just lock in on a certain team and not worrying about having to fly out and be in another city here or be in another city there or see another opponent the next night. \n\n",
  "Q.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Your bench just got nine points in Game 1 and got 21 points today.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What do you think about that? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, our bench was big for us tonight.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We needed everything that we got from them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They came in and did an excellent job of contributing offensively and defensively.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They were pretty good.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, what is the next day and a half or so going to be like for you thinking about playing an NBA Finals game back in Cleveland? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, it's going to be the same as it has been being out here.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Round\u2011the\u2011clock treatment, get my body, get my mind ready for the game. \r\nI get an opportunity to go home.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I haven't seen my wife, seen my kids in four or five days.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Give them some big hugs, big kisses, and then I'm going to lock back in.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So it's the same thing for me.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What did you do after the shock of losing Game 1 and the news about Kyrie to get the team's spirits up heading into this game? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just letting them understand and telling them about the moment, the moment that we're in, not about the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think the game is such a small thing, when you think about the moment and compare it to the moment.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We have a chance to be a part of history, but it's the small steps that you take to get to that point. \r\nSo mentally, physically, just having those guys ready, throwing things in their ears to try to let them understand what this is all about, and they responded very well.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Have you ever played with a guy like Matthew Dellavedova before?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And what was going through your mind when he was at the free\u2011throw line? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, I think he's unique in his own way.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously he's a guy that's been counted out his whole life.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Probably people have been telling him he's too small, he's not fast enough, can't shoot it enough, can't handle it good enough, and he's beat the odds so many times. \r\nThe confidence that we have in him allows him to be confident in himself.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He goes out and he just plays his tail off, and when a guy like that does that, he gets great results.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And about the free throws?\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, he was very calm.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Before you get to the free throws, just to follow up on the missed three by J.J., usually when J.J., J.R. and Mike Miller shoot, we don't rebound, because most of the time they make them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So for us, for Delly to be able to crash in and get that and go up there and knock two free throws down, that was huge.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Your coach said that you guys were the underdog and you were written off.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You guys were written off coming into this game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How much is that a personal motivation for you and how important, how good does it feel to get a rare\u2011\u2011 to get a loss\u2011\u2011 to get a win in Golden State? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean, I don't need any extra motivation.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think our guys love it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Our guys love the fact that we've been counted out and come into the series being an underdog.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They're pretty much saying that especially after Kyrie got hurt and the series was over.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think our guys are using that as motivation.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I use a little bit of it, but I have a lot of motivation already to just be a part of greatness and be a part of this and be a part of this atmosphere. \r\nMy motivation is to make sure my guys are ready and prepared every night we step on the floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And I have some other motivation that I won't talk about right now, but I have so many different things to worry about than being an underdog or guys counting us out.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, just take us through Delly's performance on Steph Curry.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's one of Steph's probably worst shooting performances in his career. \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It had everything to do with Delly.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He just kept a body on Steph.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He made Steph work.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He was spectacular, man, defensively.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We needed everything from him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When Steph shoots the ball, you just automatically think it's going in because he shoots the ball so well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, he stunned me on one in the fourth quarter where he just took an in\u2011and\u2011out dribble and raised for a three and he nailed it and that wasn't on Delly. \r\nHe just did a great job.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just trying to make it tough on Steph.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's all you can do.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You make it tough on him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You get a contest, and you live with the results, and I think Delly did that.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've talked about different versions of this team this year.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What is the identity of the team right now, and when did you discover that maybe it could be a grittier team than you had anticipated? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah, that's what it is, it's the grit squad that we have.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's not cute at all.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If you're looking for us to play sexy, cute basketball, then that's not us.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's not us right now.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Everything is tough.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, we're going to come in with an aggressive mindset defensively and offensively. \r\nAnd for us to win a Finals game shooting 32 percent from the field, it's just a testament of how gritty we can be.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It has to be that for the rest of the series, no matter how many games it takes.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If you go back and look through just at all your games, all your performances, I don't think, especially in the playoffs, you've ever done what you've pulled off personally the last two games.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There are a number of different ways you can answer this, but where is it coming from? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 (Laughing).\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It just comes from the work ethic.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When the 20,000\u2011plus fans aren't there and you guys aren't there, I mean, you see it because you're probably with me every day and some of your other guys or some of our other beat writers, you guys see how much work I put into my craft every day, before, after practice. \r\nWhen you put that much work in there, you live with the results.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For me to be able to go out on the biggest stage and to be able to make plays happen for my teammates is the ultimate feeling for myself.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's why I take my profession, I take my craft very seriously.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You mentioned I believe yesterday, you said you could play 41, 42 minutes.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You played well over that tonight and still played\u2011\u2011 you were a force each and every minute on the court. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0The next question everybody's going to ask is can this continue?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Are you built for this? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, am I built for it?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, of course I'm built for it (laughing).\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, it's a maximum of five games left in the NBA season.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So I'm ready for whatever.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just piggybacking on that, two overtime games, 90\u2011something minutes for you.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How much are you feeling it right now?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And did you come into tonight's game with a little bit different edge knowing you didn't have Kyrie to lean on a little? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Did you see how I walked in here?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm feeling it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm feeling it right now for sure.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's why I've got one of the best trainers in the world in Mike Mancias who will make sure I'm ready for Game 3.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We already have started on my rehab.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Already started on my session.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I will get rehab on the plane.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've got a five\u2011hour flight back home, and we've got all\u2011around\u2011the\u2011clock treatment tomorrow and get ready for Game 3.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'll be ready.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Byron Scott used to talk about the injured dog theory; that an injured dog is the most frightening dog.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you guys feel like that's where you're at right now? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, all we can do is go out and play hard.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're undermanned.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, we're without two All\u2011Stars, and I don't know any other team in this league that would be able to do that, to be able to be without two All\u2011Stars on their team and compete the way we compete and be a force.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So the guys are taking that very personal. \r\nFor us mentally we can't allow\u2011\u2011 the one thing we can't allow is what everyone is saying about us affect what we need to do out on the floor, because that's just smoke and mirrors of what everybody else says about us or what they think is going to happen with the series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What truly matters is what we have as a game plan and how we go out and execute it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's all that matters.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, I think you would prefer not to have to shoot 38 or 34 shots a game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What's it like for you to play this way and know that you do have to go out there and do this? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, the good thing about tonight, I took 34 shots, but I had my 11 assists.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Once again, I was knocking on the 40 door again.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So they let me score 40 again.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That felt pretty\u2011\u2011 I'm happy I'm able to do that in a win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So just to go out\u2011\u2011 I'm not a high\u2011volume shooter.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've never been in my career.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But things have changed on our team where the shots that Kevin and Kyrie would have has now been placed on myself and the rest of the guys as well. \r\nIt's what needs to be done to help our team win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Am I going to be in the 30s every game or things of that nature?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm not sure.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I would not like to.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But if that's what the case has to be to help us win, then I don't have a choice.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You obviously won four of these, but this is the first Finals win in Cavaliers history.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You obviously are a man of history.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What's this mean to you? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It means everything.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It means everything to be able to be a part of history and to get this win for this franchise, for our city, for all the Cavs fans all over the world. \r\nAnd if I can leave my fans with something, these fans here are pretty loud, pretty good, really good.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm looking forward to seeing our fans and I can't wait to see our fans.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've heard our fans pretty loud before.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 A couple instances my first postseason appearance was really loud, and me coming home against the Knicks at the start of the season was pretty good.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I know we can be much, much louder than any fan base in this league. \r\nI know they're getting ready, and I can't wait to see them. \n\n",
  "Q.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, I guess I'll ask you, when did you first find out about Kyrie's situation?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know you guys have been through this before with him being out, but is there a difference it being at this stage against a good opponent like this? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I found out about it yesterday when everybody else found out about it on our squad.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's a tough pill to swallow.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously, we've been in this situation, but we always knew at some point he'll come back.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Knowing that he's out for the rest of The Finals and out for a period of a long time, first of all, it sucks for him personally.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's a huge blow for our team, especially at this stage. \r\nYou want to try to be as close to full strength as possible throughout these games, especially when you're going against a worthy opponent like we're facing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So it's a tough situation for our team, and guys have to pick up in his absence.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, as far as your Finals challenge with Kyrie's injury, is this as challenging as 2007 or most challenging thing you've had to try to overcome in your Finals experiences? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, I said it's going to be one of the most challenging seasons of my career from the beginning, and this just adds on to it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, we're undermanned right now.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But we've got guys in the locker room that are ready for the challenge, and we look forward to the challenge tomorrow night.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you feel like you've got to be more aggressive or more a facilitator with this injury? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, if I get more aggressive than 36 shots (laughing), I might have about 58 of them things tomorrow night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know how much more aggressive you want me to get at this point.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How many minutes can you play in a 48\u2011minute game? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 At a Finals? \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah. \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 40, 41, 42.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 In regular season pace, I can give you all 48.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I play extremely hard throughout the postseason, and I'd be cheating my team if I said I could go out and play 48 minutes.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think that's impossible.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Coming into this series obviously people thought the Warriors were the favorite.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Now, I don't think I've ever seen a team you're on being written off the way you are.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is it motivating or is it annoying or are you just kind of down about the way the situation is, that this is going to be such a tough challenge? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, first of all, I don't really know what the noise is outside.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I haven't heard about anything, obviously, besides just Kyrie being out.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That is the only thing I've heard.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Understand that we was the underdog coming into the series, and with Kyrie being out people are writing us off.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So, I mean, that's fine.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's fine.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm motivated to get our guys ready to go tomorrow, and we will be ready.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 J.R. was telling me that he used to play basketball with you in Akron in the summers early in his career.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you tell me about that and how that came about and what your relationship was like from all the way back to those days? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I saw a gifted kid.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've always had an open\u2011gym policy for young guys that are trying to get better.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He was one of those guys.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just seeing the talent that he had at such a young age, you know, we've had our friendship and that's gone a long way before, obviously, getting to this point in The Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Now we're teammates. \r\nHe's had a heck of a career to this point.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's been misunderstood throughout his career.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But this year he showcased and showed who he is and who he truly wants to be known as in this league, and that's a great teammate, a knockdown shooter, a guy who competes and plays to win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's been great to have him as part of this team.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Steph Curry is your opponent in these Finals and you're going after the same common goal.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Only one of you guys can win it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But are there any ways you can relate to him being now the MVP, the face of the league, and all the pressures that goes along with that? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't think there's much pressure on him at all.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think he's had an unbelievable season.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Got the MVP, rightfully so.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Led his team all year long.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't think it's much pressure on him, though.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, for him to just go out there and play his game, he has a great supporting cast.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He has a great team. \r\nBut I think he just goes out and plays.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't think anybody has put too much pressure on him to do anything besides what he's been doing all year.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Why do you play so well here, and is there something about Oracle that you seem to like? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know, man.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 First of all, I love\u2011\u2011 I always said I love the road much more than I love home.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I get excited to be on the road and trying to take the crowd out of it and make big shots with the crowd going crazy and things of that nature. \r\nIt's a great fan base here.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They know the game of basketball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They know so much history of the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They've had so many greats come in here either from opponents or their respective team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just try to be remembered when I'm in this building at the end of the day.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It came out that you and Steph Curry were born in the same hospital 39 months apart.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Got any reaction to that? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think it's pretty cool.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, it's the true definition of It's a small world for sure, being in this situation today and knowing that we were born in the same hospital, not too far apart.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So it's pretty cool for our city, for the city that I stand for every single day when I wake up.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 To know a great guy like that was born in the same city, it means a lot to us. \n\n",
  "Q.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You got 16 shots in the paint, 22 shots outside the paint.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You hit 11 in the paint, 7 outside.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you need to get more shots in the Lane, and what can you do to do that? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm going to continue to mix it up.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Whatever the defense or the game presents itself, I'll be ready to adjust.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'll play both inside and outside, and I like to keep the defense off balance.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 This team is back in a situation where you don't know Kyrie's status again.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How confident are you that somebody else, one or two of your teammates, will be able to do what they did in previous rounds? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The good thing about it, we've been in this position before.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If he's not able to go\u2011\u2011 we're not quite sure right now.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But if he's not able to go, it's something that's not new to us.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So next man up, and guys will be ready for the challenge.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just talking to J.R., and he was talking about your last shot in regulation and you're kind of damned if you do and damned if you don't and people used to criticize you for not taking that shot, now you take it in rhythm and people are criticizing you for that as well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What did you think of the look?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Does that matter to you what people\u2011\u2011 how they analyze your shot selection? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean, when you take a shot and you miss you have so many different thoughts in your mind saying okay, I should have done this or I should have done that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you take a shot and you make it, there is really nothing else to think about.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But for me I got to a spot where I'm comfortable making the shot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Stepback going left, that's a shot that I'm very capable of making obviously in rhythm, which I was.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It just didn't go down for me. \r\nI really don't hear the criticism and things of that nature because I don't read anything.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't see anything.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't watch anything.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So that stuff really\u2011\u2011 it never gets to me really, so it doesn't bother me at all.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Two questions.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The Warriors have talked about Harrison Barnes, Iguodala talked about they're okay with you getting your points as long as everybody else is not getting theirs.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How do you combat that?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Number two, why the early workout?

\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, there are a few things that you would love to have going late in the season.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's being healthy, having a great rhythm, and then you need a little luck as well. \r\nWe've had a great rhythm.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We haven't had much luck, and we haven't been healthy.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I haven't gotten discouraged.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I understand the moment that I'm in, and I'm not too much worried about the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm worried about the moment.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm happy with the moment.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm excited to be in this moment once again, and I'm going to stay strong for my team, no matter who is or is not in the lineup.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've been in this situation not only, of course, in these playoffs losing Game 1, but throughout your career losing Game 1 of The Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you take us through just sort of I guess the mindset when you lose a Game 1 and what you have to fight through to get ready for Game 2? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's not a great feeling, for sure.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I didn't get much sleep last night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You just play\u2011\u2011 your mind just plays with you so much throughout the course of the night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Different plays, different scenarios, different points of the game where you could have made a play here, could have made a play there to help your team win. \r\nSo the mind never lets you at ease.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So it's always a tough 24 or 48 or whatever case, how many hours it is.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But at some point you get to the film room, which I've already started, and you start to prepare yourself mentally on what needs to be done going into Game 2.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It looks like, sort of following up on that, that they'll let you have 40 and you would prefer to pass, how do you deal with that?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Also, do you think Shumpert's shot was in at the buzzer? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, first of all, you can't let me have 40.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Correct.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Correct. \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah, yeah.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You don't let me have 40.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I go get 40.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's not like they're just getting out of the way.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So those guys aren't saying we're okay with letting him have 40.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You don't let me have 40; I'm making those shots. \r\nFrom my angle, it did look like it had a great chance of going in, and it just didn't fall.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, Draymond remembers when he was a rookie the first time I think he faced you when you were with the Heat in 2012.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There was a play in the post that you kind of abused him and you said, You're too small.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He said that motivated him to this day; he still thinks about it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you remember the moment, and what do you think of the way he's evolved since that moment in his rookie year? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, if you knew Draymond, he started the trash talking first in that game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm not much of a trash talker, but he started it first his rookie year.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So don't let him try to start up a story on why he's motivated because I said something.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He started it, and I finished it (smiling).\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What is your point of view on the Warriors' defense and how they're approaching you?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And when you survey the court, what are you seeing? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, they had different\u2011\u2011 they mixed it up last night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes they didn't dig in the post.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes they let me play one\u2011on\u2011one.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes Bogut was over on the tilt and brought two defenders.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They switched sometimes on pick\u2011and\u2011rolls.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes they went under. \r\nSo they were giving me everything.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They're not just giving me one steady dosage of we're going to just let him play.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's what they want to get out to you guys, but that's not what's happening.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah, I see it all throughout the course of the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They've given me different match\u2011ups, just trying to keep me off balance. \r\nBut I've seen it all, and I've got to do a better job as well getting my other guys involved.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm okay with getting big numbers and things of that nature, but I feel much better when I'm able to get my guys in rhythm and get them guys some more looks. \r\nSo I think one of the things is trying to stay at home on a lot of my shooters.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They didn't give James Jones as much air space.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 J.R. got a couple good looks, it just didn't go down.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He had one where Kyrie kind of fell, pitched it to him, he had a three.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He had one in the corner in overtime that kind of went off the side of the backboard.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But he's capable of making that shot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've got to get those guys involved as well.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know that you like to not take as much shots and distribute to your team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You just said that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How are you going to get that done? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm going to just go play the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just go play the game and see where it takes you.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's not\u2011\u2011 sometimes it's not\u2011\u2011 it's not rocket science.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You just go out and see what the challenges of the game presents itself. \r\nAt the end of the day I've been playing basketball for a long time and I've seen it all.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No matter what the circumstances are, you go out and play as hard as you can and you live with the results. \n\n",
  "Q.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, I wanted to ask you about your mindset on the final possession in regulation?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You obviously made jumpers throughout the game, but you had great success getting in the paint.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I was just wondering if you were anticipating a double coming, and you might have to give up the ball and not be able to take the last shot yourself?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is that why you shot a jumper? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, my mindset was we're either going to go out of here with a win or going into overtime.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm going to get the last shot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Actually, Shumpert was able to get another look at it, but I got to where I wanted to get, step back, made them before.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had our chances.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 In the overtime, what happened in the overtime?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You got just two points? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, you just said it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We couldn't get a good look.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We couldn't get nothing to drop, including myself.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 J.R. had a really good look on the three at one point, but they just ramped it up a little bit.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They got to the free\u2011throw line, and we didn't get it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, we really only had zero points, and I got the lay\u2011up at the end, but that didn't mean much because they did a good job closing it in overtime.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Last time you guys lost in the playoffs was in Chicago Game 3, reeled off seven wins since then.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you think you guys learned anything from that experience, and can you lean on it in this situation? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean, we had a lot of miscues tonight.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think they would say the same.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had a lot of breakdowns, a couple of transition threes they made that we kind of pinpointed on saying we don't want to give those up.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But at the end of the day, we gave ourselves a chance, man.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I missed a tough one.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But we had so many opportunities to win this game, and we didn't.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's up to us now to look at the film, watch and make some adjustments, what you need to do and be ready for Sunday.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Up until that final minute, Kyrie had had such a good game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How tough was it to see him go down, and how concerned are you about him? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It was very tough to see.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just see how hard he worked these last eight days just to get himself to play at this level tonight.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Seeing him walk out of the locker room on crutches just now, that's a tough blow for our team.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Adding to that, LeBron, if Kyrie is limited at all and he can't do what you need him to do, the bench numbers were so lopsided, do you have enough you can find without him? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean, it's the next man up.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If Kyrie can't go, Delly's number is going to be called and everyone else has to pick each other up.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They outscored us 35\u20119 on bench points.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But, you know, we still had a chance to win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had a few miscues defensively.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Had a couple of turnovers offensively, but we were right there.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Like I said, they just made a couple more plays than we made.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Coach Blatt said that you had a great performance, obviously, 44 points.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But the guys around you are going to need to be better.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Your thoughts on how your teammate played tonight?

\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I'm able to pick and choose.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I do normal stuff, I guess.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I went to the movies last week at a regular movie theater.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I went to go see\u2011\u2011 I forgot the name of the movie.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I went to go see\u2011\u2011 what is the movie with the girls and they're singing?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Pitch Perfect 2, which is unbelievable.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Fat Amy is awesome.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I love her.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Wherever you are, you're awesome. \r\nI sat out at an outdoor burger place and had a burger.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Last night I went out and had a great dinner.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I do normal stuff.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think I do.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How are you feeling with the pressures that come with you? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've been in front of this since I was a 15\u2011year\u2011old kid.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously it wasn't broadcast in as many countries as it is now 15 years later, but I've been dealing with this since I was 15 years old.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Getting questioned by you guys, obviously not you guys, but my local city newspaper or when I was traveling playing basketball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So it's something I've been dealing with for half of my life.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So I think I've done a pretty cool job.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I was going to say my sister said she saw you at BurgerFi the other day.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've talked all playoffs about how much you love playing on the road.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And as you know, of course, the Warriors are really good here.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Does it take something extra to win a game in The Finals like this against a team that good at home? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You don't put too much more pressure on it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's a court and it's basketball, and it's ten guys on the court, it's three referees, and it's 20,000\u2011plus fans.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It doesn't change.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 These fans here are amazing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They've been amazing all year and for the last past few years. \r\nBut for me, I don't put too much pressure on it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've heard\u2011\u2011 I've been in so many loud arenas.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 This is going to be one of them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've played in OKC in The Finals to start off the series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've played in Boston.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've played in Detroit when they were in their heyday.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've played in Chicago in 2011 to open up the Eastern Conference Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've played in San Antonio.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So I've been in some very loud buildings, and this, obviously, I know tomorrow is going to be one of them. \r\nBut I don't add too much pressure on it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You just go out and you just try to play.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've got to command.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes you've got to have some hand signals depending on how loud they get.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But for the most part, you just trust what you've been able to do.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you look back at your first trip to the Finals in Cleveland and then the first one you won in Miami when you had Dwyane Wade who had won a championship, Warriors have zero experience in The Finals, you're going into your fifth.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How much do you think experience plays a factor on this big stage? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, it's just basketball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't like to put too much experience into it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Those guys have been playing championship basketball all year.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So why would they change?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've been playing championship basketball over the last two and a half months, so we're not going to change either, just go out and play. \r\nActually going to my sixth Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's five in a row.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But who's counting (laughing).\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've had, as you know, two buzzer beaters almost the identical spot on the floor here.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Does that mean anything to you?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you step into this building, do you call upon those vibes? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, if I get that opportunity again, I'm going to be very confident in my ability, and I know the fans will probably remember me hitting two buzzer beaters.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So if we're fortunate enough and it's a close game and we have the ball, I definitely would like the ball in my hands.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Not saying I'm going to shoot it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm going to make the right play to help our team win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But if I get a good look at it, I believe it will go down.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, your six Finals, I assume you've gotten here relatively healthy other than wear and tear of a long season.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you appreciate what Kyrie is facing right now being here for the first time not being a hundred percent healthy?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What can you say to him or what will you say to him? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I can appreciate him just fighting through it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know he sat out two games in the Atlanta series, but he's been fighting through it since the second game of the Boston series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's difficult on him for sure.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We want the best.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Whatever he can give us, it's going to be great for our team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Kyrie at 50, Kyrie at 60, Kyrie at 70 is better than Kyrie at zero. \r\nHis presence on the floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When that No. 2 Irving steps onto the court, he's a presence.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And the defense has to be aware of him, has to account for him just because of his abilities to make plays.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But you definitely can appreciate it. \r\nAny guy that is playing through injuries, I mean, we all are at this point, but he's dealing with something that's even more challenging, so you definitely commend him.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 As a student of the game, you've seen some great ball handlers during your time.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've got two incredible ones in this series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you kind of talk about what they both do so well when they handle the ball, and kind of compare and contrast Kyrie and Steph Curry? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah, they are two of the best ball handlers that this league has ever seen.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Their ability to make shots off the handle, Steph's ability to use his handle to get off shots, three step backs.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Kyrie's ability to be crafty, use his ability to get into the lane and make shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you have a handle like that, you can pretty much get any shot you want, and they both show you that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 With their speed, their change of pace, their ball handling, and then their ability to shoot the ball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They can absolutely just shoot the rock. \r\nWhen you have a handle like that, it just keeps the defender, keeps the second line of defense, third line of defense so off kilter because you don't quite know exactly where they're going to be.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, what's it like for you to be back here in Oakland?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know you had some ties to Oakland as a youth.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What would you like to say to folks here in Oakland? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I have a couple guys here.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I spent some time when I was a youth and playing some AAU ball here.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's always good to see some friends that you spent time with when you were younger.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know you're rooting for the Warriors, and that's cool.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But, you know, hopefully you were cheering for us throughout the Eastern Conference.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I saw you said the other day that you thought you were playing better now than at any other point.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is that because of sort of intellectually the way you see the game?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What goes into your feeling that way? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If I was to say just my game, I wouldn't think so.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I haven't shot the ball well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've had some high\u2011turnover games in the postseason.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So as far as just going out on the floor, I wouldn't say this is the best I've played in a stretch run.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I would think '09 I had a pretty good run when we lost to Orlando in the Eastern Conference Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I believe I averaged like 37, like 50\u2011something percent shooting in that round.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 High rebounds, high assists, and I felt really good.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just couldn't get our guys over the hump. \r\nBut I think now when you put my whole body of work, as far as how I approach the game mentally as well as my game, I'm very, very confident in my ability to be able to see the game even before the game is played.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There's a lot of excitement at home because of the Australian involvement in this game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What difference do we bring to the game, do you think, as players?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And also a lot has been said about Delly being dirty.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Are we tough players?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is that what we're all about? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you play ball? \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Not on your nelly. \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Oh, man, I was going to ask Coach to pick you up.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We need another Australian on our team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I love our Australian that we have.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I love Delly.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What he brings to our team brings just toughness and grit, determination.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just tries to beat all the odds.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's been great for us, and I know he's happy to be back here too, playing college ball here.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know he's excited being back, and should be very fun.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But, yeah, I love you Australian guys.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You guys are cool. \n\n",
  "Q.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, it seemed like you were the only player on the team to really be able to get it going there with your 31, 10, and 5.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What was the night like out there?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you play point guard and try to get your team going?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Was it frustrating?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What were the emotions of the night? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Oh, I mean, mixed emotions.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Started off very well as a team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had a great first quarter.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But from that point on, they were the better team, and that's why they're the champions in 2014.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 To follow\u2011up, obviously, you have a very big decision coming up.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How will this game impact that decision, and what do you think your potential timetable will be on your decision? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I haven't even really thought about that just yet.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Not disappointed in any of my teammates, just wish we could have came through, played a better series, but obviously we ran up against a better team this year. \r\nLike I said, I haven't even thought about it yet.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Dwyane, you gave the Spurs a lot of credit for what they were able to do to you guys.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But what was the biggest difference for you physically in this series, versus what you did in the Conference Finals against Indiana where you seemed to have your game? \r\nDWYANE WADE:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Nothing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just struggled a little bit.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 As I told you guys, I'm never going to point at anything physically.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I felt fine.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just struggled a little bit offensively.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, I wish I could have done more, but it's the nature of the game, you know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So nothing physically at all.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You came to Miami to win as many titles as you can.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do the Heat have \u2011\u2011 Wade, Bosh, everybody, do they have enough in the tank to win more going forward as constituted now? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm not even nowhere near at that point.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, we went to four straight Finals in four years.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, we're not discrediting what we were able to accomplish in these four years.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We lost one, we won two, and we lost another one. \r\nTake 50% in four years in championships any day.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously, you want to win all of them, but that's just the nature of the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You win some; you lose some.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've just got to come back the next year and be better as an individual, as a team, and go from there. \r\nBut I know me and D. Wade and C.B., not proud of the way we played.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 All three of us, that's the last thing we're thinking about is what's going on this summer.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 A real quick follow\u2011up, did you notice, by chance, the swirling\u2011\u2011 even Chandler Parsons was talking about what you were going to do this week.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Everybody's been talking about you, you, you, you and Carmelo.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Have you heard that stuff and what do you think about that stuff if you've heard it or not? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I haven't heard it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It really doesn't matter to me what people say at all.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 In those first six minutes, was that the kind of basketball you were hoping for?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Did you feel at that point like you guys were going to be able to make a standpoint? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just wanted to try to inspire my teammates and came out very aggressive, made some shots, got to the free\u2011throw line.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Tried to inspire my teammates to try to get a win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously, I didn't do enough.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Chris Bosh described this\u2011\u2011 the Spurs as the best basketball team he's ever played against.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How would you characterize what you ran into in the Finals? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I would agree.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They were the much better team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's what team basketball and that's how team basketball should be played.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, it's selfless.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Guys move, cut, pass, you've got a shot, you take it, but it's all for the team and it's never about the individual.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's the brand of basketball, and that's how team basketball should be played.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 As a leader of this team, what do you tell your teammates, specifically the younger ones and the new ones, about dealing with a loss like this and how can they help you in the future? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, it's hard to say anything.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, everyone is going through their own emotions right now.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Everyone deals with it a little differently.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For me, I keep my head high.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I understand the position I've been able to put myself and put this team in since I got here, so my head stays high and I'm going to stay positive and use this as another opportunity to get better next year. \r\nBut everyone is different.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What have these four years meant being together and playing together, off the court, all of that?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What have these years been like for you guys?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is it what you expected or more? \r\nDWYANE WADE:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, we didn't know what to expect when we decided to become teammates years ago.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We just knew that we felt as individuals that we could do it, that we could put our egos to the side and not care about the individual part of the game and become a great team and become two leaders of that team. \r\nIt's been a hell of a ride in these four years.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And when we decided to play together, we didn't say, okay, let's try for four years.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We said let's just play together and let's see what happens. \r\nWe've been successful in the sense of what we tried to accomplish, and that is going to the Finals, and we did it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We'd love to be four for four, it just wasn't in the cards for us to be that. \r\nWe have no other reason not to be proud of each other for what we've accomplished on and off the court for these four years together.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, what are your thoughts about what you've learned over the years from management, coaches, just how the organization has treated you? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, I play for my teammates every single night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't really get involved in management and all of that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's not my job.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I play for my teammates.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I try to lead my teammates.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I try to inspire my teammates.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I let guys do their job and I do mine.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Kawhi Leonard is Finals MVP.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Could you talk about what you saw from him especially over these last three games and how much he's grown from last year? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Very efficient.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, he's very efficient.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The first two games he didn't play so well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I thought he attacked more in the last three games, shot the ball extremely well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Every year you gain more and more confidence.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Guys give you confidence, and he played extremely well. \r\nDWYANE WADE:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah, it's like he just played free.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You could tell after the first two games, it seemed like his teammates went to him and said just play basketball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He not only took what the defense gave him, he took what he wanted at times as well. \r\nSo he's a young player who is growing up in this league, and everyone knows what Coach Pop says:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's the future of this team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And he did an unbelievable job of playing the role they needed him to play.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you said in February you couldn't picture yourself leaving Miami.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you still feel that way? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, I will deal with my summer when I get to that point.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Me and my team will sit down and deal with it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I love Miami.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 My family loves it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But obviously right now that's not even what I'm thinking about. \r\nYou guys are trying to find answers.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm not going to give you one.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm just not going to give it to you.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When I get to that point, I'll deal with it, and when it gets to that point.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How do you handle this loss at this point in your career compared to the other two times you lost in the Finals? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 First time I lost, as a team we were excited to get there.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We were more excited to get there than to win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, obviously, we would have loved to win that game and win that series, but the Spurs were more dominant than us.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They were more seasoned.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They had been there a few years and they took advantage of our youth and inexperience. \r\nThree years ago, our first year here, that was probably more hurtful than this one in the sense of we had put so much into it, we were going through so much.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That Dallas team was the better team in that series as well. \r\nObviously, they all hurt.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 This year they dominated us from every facet of the game\u2011\u2011 offensively, defensively.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, they all hurt, but I've been able to be a part of five of them, and I would love to sit up here and say I was 5\u20110, but I'm not.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm 2\u20113.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But a lot of guys don't get this opportunity to even compete for a championship, and I've been blessed to compete for five of them in my 11 years so far.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If you guys do return intact next season, the big three and a few other players, what do you need to add, change, to beat this Spurs team, if you were to meet them again? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't think it's just the Spurs.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's the whole league.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The whole league continues to get better every single year.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously we would need to get better from every facet, every position.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's just how the league works. \r\nThe Spurs continue to get better.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously, they kept those three guys intact, but they continue to put guys around them, high\u2011basketball\u2011IQ guys around them, high\u2011energy guys around them that fit into the system of what Pop wanted to do. \r\nObviously, it's not just about the Spurs.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's about the whole league.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The whole league is excited about returning next season, and we'll see what happens. \n\n",
  "Q.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Look at your numbers in these Finals, 28 points, 60% from the floor, 61 from three.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know you're harder on yourself than anybody else, but has there been a point in the last couple days where you ask yourself what more you can really do at this point? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I haven't even\u2011\u2011 I haven't looked at my numbers because it's meant one win, and that's what it comes down to for us and for me personally.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I feel like I haven't even looked at the numbers.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I had no idea what I was shooting from the field or what I was averaging. \r\nI've been telling myself I need to do more.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is it too much to ask myself?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I need to do more because what I'm doing isn't enough.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, it's just what I put on myself.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If you told me I was averaging 28, shooting 60% from the floor and 61 from the three\u2011point line and we'd be down 3\u20111, I would never give you another interview, Tim, and I like you (laughing). \r\nBut that's what the team is all about.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's team basketball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I put a lot more.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I need to get to 32, and 65 and 65 from the field and three.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's just the pressure I put on myself, man.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's what I've come to.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So what has your message to these guys been over the last 36 hours then? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, just we need to win one game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's all we can think about.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We can't think about forcing a Game 7.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We have to win one game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Game 5, being here in a hostile environment, we know if we lose, the season is over. \r\nFor me, it's like you either don't make the playoffs or you win a championship.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There's no in between.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't want no first\u2011round victory, no second\u2011round victory, no Eastern Conference Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Either I don't make the playoffs or I would rather get my two months off, get my body rested or win the Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't want no in between. \r\nObviously, we have a tall task, a tough task, but we're here, we're in the moment, and do your best.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just go out and perform, play basketball at a high level.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Something you've been doing your whole life.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Live with the results, man, and go from there.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You mentioned team basketball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You haven't been the problem in the series, obviously.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What more do you need out of your teammates? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just want my teammates to be themselves, man.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, I feel like I need to do more too.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's how I am.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 My teammates are everything.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously I wouldn't be sitting up here with this, the NBA Finals thing behind me, without them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, and they've been there all year, and I still believe in them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The guys that are struggling, I believe they're going to have a big game tomorrow.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The guys that haven't been in a rhythm, I feel like tomorrow's going to be the best rhythm they've been in. \r\nTomorrow might be the game where I need to be picked up like I was in Game 1 where I caught a cramp.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I believe in them, and I ride with them no matter what.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Dwyane just came out and said yesterday he went to the gym by himself to get a feel for the ball and smell the gym after what happened in the last game for him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What do you expect from him in the next game, and how motivated do you think he is right now? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, you expect everyone to be great.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 This is the biggest moment of the season.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But the game has to play itself out.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I expect for him to be great.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I expect all our guys to be great or put themselves in a position where we can succeed. \r\nBut that's why you also have to play the game as well and see what happens throughout the course of the game and then after the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We can all wonder what may happen tomorrow or whatever the case may be, but you have to live in the moment.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You talk about how you guys all get together well and talking about that for three years.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You do emote at times on the court.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Are there times when a star teammate maybe doesn't get back on defense, isn't doing the right thing, where you might be more vocal than we see?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And might there be a need to do that more often amidst a period of desperation like this? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's easy to say that now being down 3\u20111 in a series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How I'll lead is how I believe a guy should lead.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How I believe is how I think I should lead.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, you may be different, someone else may be different how they lead.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So I won't change my approach. \r\nI hold guys accountable.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't let things slide.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I hold guys accountable and I want guys to be great while they're out on the floor and do what's best for the team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If you do that, you put the team before yourself, then I can live with that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So my leadership approach is different from others and I live with it.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 As the Finals have progressed, a lot more speculation about the future of the big three has occurred.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Knowing that major decisions need to be made this summer, does that add to the motivation of getting the job done knowing that the team may not be the same as it is right now?\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And do you think about your decision that needs to be made over the summer as well? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, no, not really.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't need any motivation about the summertime or whatever something that's going on after the fact.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I live too much in the moment.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I can't worry about what goes on after this series is over with.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Win, lose or draw, I live now and worry about the future once it's upon me.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What have you done to get the problem with the cramps under control?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know you're drinking coconut water right now.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What have you done since Game 1 to get a handle on that? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just try to stay hydrated.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I haven't changed much.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've got the two and a half bags of IV after Game 1, and that got me above the curve, so I just kind of stayed in the same regiment.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I drink a lot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I drink a lot of fluids, water and drinks, and hydrate all day long. \r\nSo I haven't done anything that was kind of like out of my character or anything of that nature.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's just something that I've had a few times in my career, and something that may happen again in the future.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Hopefully, it's not the near future.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I can't have it happen tomorrow.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Somebody's going to have to really come get me tomorrow if that happens.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So I'm just staying above the curve, that's all.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Was it really just an issue with the temperature inside the arena? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Both teams were playing extremely hard.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It was obviously something I've\u2011\u2011 I haven't played in conditions like that since I was a kid where you had no choice but to play in conditions like that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I caught cramps in the Finals game in our first time we won against OKC in Game 4.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That took me out of the game for a little bit.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't remember it being extremely hot, but it is Miami, so it could have been a little warm in there. \r\nSo it was extreme conditions in Game 1.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But nothing I could have done about it.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What's been the main problem for you guys defensively when it comes to fighting through or sorting out their screens? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, it's not the screens.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think it's the motor that they're playing with.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's the second situations, the third situations, the fourth situations, and we've watched film where we've been on top of exactly what they're doing and they've still made shots. \r\nWe played \u2011\u2011 I think it was Game 3 at the end of the first quarter, we played the pick\u2011and\u2011roll, the second situation extremely well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Manu got the switch on Bird, we played exactly how we wanted to, he shot a step back three and it went in off the glass.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So it's the ones where you actually don't play it exactly how you should, and they still make you pay. \r\nYou know, this is the No. 1 team in the league that they'll make you pay when you're right on top of what they're doing, and they'll make you pay when you make a mistake, and we have to limit the times that we're making mistakes when we're on defense.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You mentioned your ankle the other day.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When did that happen and what is the status of it now? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I turned my ankle in Game\u2011\u2011 it happened Game 2.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I fouled Manu, I believe, in the third quarter, and I kind of fell on the ground right in front of our bench.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah, I think that was Game 2 in the third quarter and I turned it at that point or in the fourth quarter, and it's kind of been \"ahh\" for the rest of the series. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is it a sprain? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't want to say a sprain.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I turned it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's a little sore, but it hasn't limited me much.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 As the night goes on, it gets a little worse and worse, but I'm okay.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Energy has been a problem it seems like later on in Games 3 and 4.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is there anything you guys can do differently to conserve energy other than not falling behind so quickly? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I actually think the energy has been bad from the start.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 From quarter 1 we haven't matched their intensity.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Second quarter we've played some okay ball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Third quarter our energy has been the best in the third quarters where we've tried to work and work to get back. \r\nWhen you exert that much energy versus a team like this who continues to move, who continues to get into their sets, continue to use the 24 seconds and move the ball, and move the ball, and move the ball, and they make those shots at the end of the shot clock, it takes a lot of energy from you doing that. \r\nWe haven't played even basketball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We haven't played good basketball since Game 2.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So they've taken a lot of energy away from us because we've played catch\u2011up.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is there any major adjustment at this point that can be made? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm not the adjustment guy to ask.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's not my question (laughing).\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You seem to be in a pleasant mood.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Are you angry, disappointed over the last couple days?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What is your frame of mind like? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Of course, of course.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm extremely\u2011\u2011 I was extremely upset, sad, very emotional to myself after 3 and 4.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, you ask me, all the bad emotions you could have. \r\nToday is a new day.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I have another opportunity to help this team keep our season going.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I also know that\u2011\u2011 I don't know, man.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm in a good place in my life.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's basketball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I understand it's the media and the sport is the greatest sport in the world.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I love it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's done so many great things for me, but it's just basketball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's just basketball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So I let it\u2011\u2011 I go all into it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I give everything to this game. \r\nBut right after Game 4 I was in the ice tub in the locker room, and my two boys coming running in there talking about let's play some more basketball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I was like, If y'all don't get away from me\u2011\u2011 it's the last thing I want to do right now.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But it puts things in perspective, and I'm able to have a clear head about it.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You seem to have a peace of mind maybe more than you did a few years ago about taking losses and the ups and downs. \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean, two championships helps that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It helps it, for sure.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But understanding what means a lot to me. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0Understanding what's important and understanding what's not important allows me to kind of just live in the moment and not focus on what's happened in the past. \r\nI can't control the past.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I can't redo it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I can live in the present, try to affect the future and live with the results while I'm in it.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You talked about sometimes you guys play good defense and they score, sometimes you don't and they score.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You guys had some defensive slippage this season in the regular season.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you feel like bad habits have come back to bite you at all in this series, or do you feel like even if you were playing your best defense in these last few years you'd still be in this hole? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean, in the regular season I got frustrated a lot, but it was a lot because we have guys in and out of the lineup.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm all about chemistry and habits, and it affected our team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There were guys that didn't know if they were playing, did know they were playing, and it affected our team a little bit. \r\nI don't believe\u2011\u2011 I believe when we got into the playoffs we got everything that we needed to happen.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We got guys healthy, and we got defensively exactly where we wanted to be.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Great offense beats great defense any day.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But at the same time, we've had some mistakes, you know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And if we limit our mistakes, we give ourselves a good chance to win it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If we don't, then it will be over tomorrow night, if we don't limit our mistakes, and it's just that simple.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Ever since I guess maybe throughout the entire playoffs it seems like you've always been the last voice that the team hears before they come out for warm\u2011ups and with a million TV cameras around, we see some of those.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What will you end up saying tomorrow night, or is it always totally organic off the top of the head? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah, it is.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I have no idea.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It would be in the range of:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Why not us?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Why not us?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 History is broken all the time.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And obviously we know we're against the greatest of odds.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No team has ever come back from a 3\u20111 deficit in the Finals, but there was a point where no team came back from a 2\u20110.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There was a point where no team came back from a 3\u20110.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There was a point where no team came back from a 3\u20111 deficit in the Western Conference Finals, and then Phoenix did it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 One of our teammates was on that team, James Jones. \r\nThere is a point where no team came back from a 3\u20111 or 3\u20110 deficit in the ALCS, and then the Red Sox did it against the Yankees. \r\nSo history is made to be broken, and why not me be a part of it?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That would be great.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That would be a great story line, right? \r\nBut we'll see what happens.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've got to live in the moment, though, before we even get to that point. \n\n",
  "Q. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0LeBron, you left just before the start of the game, came back, and then left in the first quarter.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Was there any illness or injury or something that might have held you back tonight? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, first time I left I went to go get retaped, retape my ankle.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's been kind of bothering me for the last couple days, but I felt okay.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Second time I went back, I just had to use the restroom.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Dwyane, you struggled, it seemed, a little at the rim early.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Was there anything that was causing you not to have the same explosion?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Did you feel sort of as fit as previous games?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Could you take us through the times at the rim when you just didn't get the ball up there? \r\nDWYANE WADE:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah, I just missed them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, I'm a very accurate shooter, so I don't like missing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm not used to missing around the basket.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But law of averages, man.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The ball just didn't go in.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I'll take those same opportunities next game for sure.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously, it's not over, but you know the numbers as well as anybody in the league.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know that nobody in the Finals has ever come back from 3\u20111 down.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What is the attitude right now?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is it just about Sunday?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is it about making history?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is it something else?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What is it right now? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean, man, we put ourselves in a position where it is about making history.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But all we can do is worry about Game 5.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've got to worry about Sunday first.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Try to go up there in a hostile environment, where we were able to steal one in Game 2, and try to get another one and go on from there. \r\nObviously, I do know the numbers.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's never been done before, but we're still a confident bunch, even though our heads are lowered down right now.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Of course, being down 3\u20111, and losing two straight games at home, that's just human nature.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But we've still got to go out and play on Sunday.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you got going with the big third quarter scoring\u2011wise, what was it like at the end of that to look up and see that you had actually lost ground on the scoreboard during that? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That didn't mean nothing, you know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If it's not helping us get into the game, it didn't mean nothing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I tried to will us back into the game, but they continued to execute.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I continued to make shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I had a huge third quarter, but it meant nothing.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Erik said this was surprising tonight, and Chris said overall it was kind of blindsiding what happened in these two games.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What was your reaction at the end when you were watching the last few minutes on the bench? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, they smashed us.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Two straight home games, got off to awful starts.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They came in and were much better than us in these two games.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's just that simple.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Have you ever in two games had a team be more successful moving you strong to weak, getting the ball to the weak side and finishing plays as San Antonio has the last two games? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, coming into the series we knew that that's what it was going to be about.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They're a high\u2011oil machine and they move the ball extremely well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They put you in so many difficult positions.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If you're not right on time, right on target, they're going to make you pay for it.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You guys know what it's like to deal with adversity outside of the game, but this is the first time in a while you guys have had to deal with this kind of deficit in a series or adversity against an opponent.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How do you spend the next couple days and sort of soul\u2011search to find a way out of this? \r\nDWYANE WADE:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think, obviously, having two days in between, you take a day like tomorrow and you get away from the game physically.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Mentally you still think about it, and obviously you're going to do that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Saturday you come back and try to figure out a way to get yourselves and your team ready for the next one. \r\nAnd that's all you can do, man.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Like we continue to say, obviously, it's a game\u2011to\u2011game type of thing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Games change, individual performances change.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Did we expect to come here and lose two the way that we did at home?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No way.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But we also expect to go to San Antonio and put up a better effort and try to come out with another win. \r\nSo we'll get away from it tomorrow, but we'll still think about what we need to do to try to get another win to keep the series alive.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, as a follow\u2011up, is there any real doubt creeping in at this point that they just may be better or is it something you still feel like you have to figure out? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean, the series is not over.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've got guys with too much pride to even start thinking about that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 At the end of the day, our focus will be, how do we get better than we did in Game 3 and Game 4 here at home?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're going with that bunker mentality in Game 5. \r\nLike D Wade said, we'll get away from it tomorrow physically.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Mentally it will still be lingering around.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Saturday you start to get back into the flow of things, and then Sunday you go out and play and see what happens.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you talked about their ball movement a little bit, is it just about doing things harder or are there tactical adjustments that need to be made in your guys' view? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That sounds like a set\u2011up question.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, not really. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Not really?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Man, they move the ball extremely well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They put you in positions that no other team in this league does, and it's tough because you have to cover the ball first, but also those guys on the weak side can do multiple things.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They can shoot the ball from outside, they can also penetrate.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So our defense is geared towards running guys off the three\u2011point line, but at the same time those guys are getting full steam ahead and getting to the rim, too. \r\nThe challenge is as well, with them, implementing Diaw into the lineup has given them another point guard on the floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So Manu, Tony, and Diaw and Patty Mills on the floor at once, they've got four point guards basically on the floor at once.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So all of them are live and they all can make plays. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0So it's a challenge for us all.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You guys have not faced a deficit like this since you came together as a group, but also you personally you haven't been down 3\u20111 in a series since '09 in Orlando.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is there anything in the memory banks you can call on from that experience?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How does your approach have to change facing this kind of desperation? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, because I didn't even remember that until you just told me.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously, I'm a guy who always just kind of lives in the moment, man.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 One thing you can't do is control what happened in the past.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You can only focus on the present and hopefully you can do better in the future from your present time. \r\nFor me, I'm here at this point.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm here with the 3\u20111 deficit, and me as one of the leaders of the team, I have to figure out a way to get us to a 3\u20112 deficit.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And you worry about that, and everything else that's happened before you, you can't control it at this point.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron and Dwyane, do you really feel this is about you guys not playing up to the team you are or do you think it's as simple as they're just better than you right now? \r\nDWYANE WADE:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I think they're getting to their game a lot better than we are.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They're doing what they want to do better than we are.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So right now they're playing better than us, no question about it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We'll see at the end of the series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Whoever wins is the better team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But the Spurs are playing better than us.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They whipped our butt here at home, and you've got to give them credit for coming out, getting to their game plan, their game for 48 minutes, and we haven't been able to do that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So if we want to get back into the series, we have to be better than them on Sunday.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If not, then it will be over.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, how difficult is it to defend a team like the Spurs when they can get five or six guys to score in double figures every night? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean, they're a difficult challenge.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Like I said, I stated it before because they have so many guys that can do multiple things.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Any little mistake you make, they make you pay for it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So we have to go back to the drawing board once again, figure out ways we can slow down on the mistakes that we had and get better from it on Sunday.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you go back home in the next couple of days, having two days off, it's a long time between games, and a lot of time to think.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How will you guys roll this around in your mind?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What kind of soul\u2011searching has to take place, and how much will that help you come back for Sunday strong? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Soul\u2011searching, there won't be much of that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There won't be much of that at all for me.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Crazy thing is my two boys are running around in the locker room after the game was over, so I had no time to even think about the game anymore.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They want to know what's going on right when we get home.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So having my boys around will allow me to get away from the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I will still be in tune with what I need to do to help our team win, and that's my mindset. \r\nBut as far as soul\u2011searching, we're a veteran ballclub that's won a championship, that's won a couple championships, that's been to four straight Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We know what it takes to win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've just got to go out and do it. \r\nDWYANE WADE:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think the biggest thing you can do is first individually.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There's no \"I\" in team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There is an \"I\" in individual.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You have to look at yourself and see what you can bring better to the game to be able to help this team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Then as a team we've got to continue to trust and believe in each other, like we've done for four years here, like we've done all season.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm confident that we will do that. \r\nI mean, you've just got to look at yourself first, and then after that, we look at each other and see how we can all help each other get better.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, at times it seems as if the offense is struggling and stagnant, asking you to go one\u2011on\u2011one, shoot deep threes, be amazing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you talk about that pressure and how it might be mentally taxing on you after four years now? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't really get caught up in what pressure is all about.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, just go out and play basketball, play as hard as you can and live with the results.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For me, I do whatever it takes to help our team win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If it's me going one\u2011on\u2011one to try to help us win, if it's me getting guys involved and taking threes in rhythm, then I'll do it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I don't really get caught up in the pressure.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is it mentally exhausting?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't think in any of the games you guys have had a lead in the first quarter, to have to come back from so many deficits and all of that on your shoulder?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You definitely don't want to\u2011\u2011 it's not on my shoulder.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's not.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I understand I get a lot of the limelight in the press and all that, but it's not all on my shoulder.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I take a lot of it, but I do it for my teammates and I want them to put a lot of pressure on me in that sense. \r\nBut going into the first quarter is how you start games off, and you don't ever want to go into the second quarter being down.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But it is what it is.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That is the way the series has played out thus far.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, we have another game on Sunday to kind of right the ship and get better from it, and not be down like we've done in these first four games, because it's not been a successful ingredient for us.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Coach Spoelstra said that it's time to just look under the hood and no stone should be unturned.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 At this point are all of the stones already unturned going into tonight's game? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't even know what that means (laughter).\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I got an engine underneath my hood.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I have no idea what that means.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Trying to find any option to win the game. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, that should be the goal from the start, you know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Whoever can make plays and put your teammates in position to win, all the stones should be unturned.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That shouldn't happen in The Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That should happen from day one.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You come into training camp and you find guys, you put guys on the floor to complement each other, and you put guys on the floor, and we all help each other on the floor from the coaches to the players.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So shouldn't wait until you get to The Finals for that. \r\nThanks for clarifying that, too, because I had no idea what you were talking about (laughing). \n\n",
  "Q. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0LeBron, this was some of what an uneven season.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Defensive struggles along the way, trying to find rhythm, some losses that were unexpected.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Are you surprised that some of the problems you had during the season could resurface this late in the game like the defensive struggles, some of the uneven bench play, and how much of a concern is that? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Oh, well, I mean, we have to fix some things for sure, but I'm not too concerned.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I believe in our system, believe in our teammates and we have to for sure play a better game than we did in Game 3.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We learn from our mistakes and we have to bring a better approach or better physical mindset into Game 4.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you think some bad habits\u2011\u2011 you spoke about this during the season, maybe too many bad habits set in and maybe they came to roost a little later now in the playoffs? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, you hope not.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't believe so.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I believe we've played pretty good basketball throughout the postseason, so I don't believe they'll come back.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That was something we were going through the regular season and we've pretty much cleaned up.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How was a two\u2011hour film session like with Coach Spoelstra? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's pretty demanding, for sure.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He gets up under us and we've got to own our mistakes, and that's what it was all about.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The way The Finals obviously is and how crucial every loss is, when you think back to Game 1 and the circumstances of that one and you think about Game 3 and how you guys came out, does that make those losses even more painful thinking about it? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, I mean, a loss is a loss in the postseason, and a loss is a loss in the Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, they're all painful no matter if you lose by 30 or you lose by 1.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They're all painful.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's what it's about when you get to this point in the season.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Have you ever been a part of a game that it seemed like the other team was just making everything, like the Spurs were last night? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Not that I can recall.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've been a part of some really good shooting teams, playing against them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But obviously, it's still fresh in my mind.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So not that I can recall.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is that because they were just hot or your mistakes more so? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It was a combination of both.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How do you guys keep Mario from \u2011 he said just now this is a tough Finals for him and his confidence is starting to shift.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How do you keep him up because you guys are going to need him? \r\nLeBRON JAMES: \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0Well, I mean, we do.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's been our starting point guard in our back\u2011to\u2011back championship runs and he played a key role in it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And he can't lose confidence in himself. \r\nWe can give\u2011\u2011 at the end of the day, you can give a guy as much confidence as you want, but when a guy loses confidence in himself, it can be all downhill, and that's one thing he can't do.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He can't lose confidence in himself or his abilities. \r\nWe need him out on the floor to make plays.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's our point guard.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He puts us in our sets and we need him to make shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But more than anything, we need him just to demand being a point guard and being reliable offensively, being reliable defensively, and putting himself and our teammates in position to succeed, and that's what it's about.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You can't lose confidence in yourself more than anything.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You guys haven't lost back\u2011to\u2011back playoff games since 2012.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What is the process like of bouncing back in the playoffs?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is it fair to say that you're comfortable in this situation, though you'd rather not be in it? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, you're not comfortable.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You never get comfortable in a playoff series ever.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You're always on edge throughout the whole series until it's over, either with a win or a defeat.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So you're never comfortable.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You just try to learn from your mistakes that you made in the previous game, and not make the same ones the next game.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've had your share of guys who attempted to challenge your talent.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Indiana, Paul George, and Lance Stephenson.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Could you talk about the challenges of Kawhi Leonard, playing him and the game he had last night? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, Kawhi had a really impactful game last night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It started off with him going to the free\u2011throw line.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That always helps you get a free throw or a lay\u2011up, and then he got a breakaway dunk and a transition three, and that kind of got him into the flow of things, so he kept it going. \r\nHe's a really good talent, and he's a big piece of their puzzle.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So it's challenging, for sure.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But at this point, it should be.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Erik talks about it owning mistakes.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What is that process?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How are mistakes owned in the video session? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, don't talk back to the coach is how it's owned.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Let him make his point, whether he's right or wrong, and you live with it and move on.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That is the number one key.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've learned that over the years.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Chris's touches were way down yesterday from the first two games.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is that just a product of the game kind of getting scrambled and you guys trying to will it back?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Or was there something happening early in the game, too? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah, I think so.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think the game was getting out of control.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're trying to get in some drive\u2011and\u2011kicks for threes, things of that nature and it kind of got lost.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We hate when that happens because he's too big for our team for him to ever get lost.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He didn't miss a shot last night, but he didn't take many.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He only took four shots and we can't allow that to happen for us to be successful. \r\nSo I believe everybody was a little out of rhythm just because of the fact of how they jumped on us, and it was all scramble mode from that point.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So we all have to do a better job.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But not only seeing Chris, getting Rio, myself, everyone has to be in a good rhythm.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When did you realize at what point of your career that it was not wise to talk back to coaches in film sessions? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Quite a few years ago when you realize that it wouldn't change anything.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, the coach is going to believe \u2011\u2011 you know, the coach is always right.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's like a teacher, they're always right.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And that's fine.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's fair.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They make the rules, and we've got to live by them.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You said a few minutes ago you're not too concerned.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you ever get concerned or what would concern you? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Concerned with what? \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You said you had to fix some things but you're not too concerned. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't remember.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What was the question?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Concerned with some of our\u2011\u2011\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What's going on right now.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What happened last night. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Did I say that? \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I wrote it down.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't remember the question exactly. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You don't remember the question?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think that was coming off Ira's question, him saying am I concerned about our bad habits we had in the regular season.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And I said I'm not too concerned about that because we played some good ball over the postseason.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So that's different from am I concerned about us losing last night or losing another game. \r\nYou're always on edge in the postseason, but I don't want to be concerned at this point.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For us we have to make the adjustments.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We owned, like I said, what we had to do today in the film session and we'll come in with a better mindset tomorrow.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But that doesn't mean it results in a win, too.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But we have to play with a little bit more focus and a little bit more challenge.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is Rio the type of guy that you have to get in his head or do you let him figure whatever it is out kind of through his own or in his own way? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously, it's weighing on him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's in his head right now, I think.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He hasn't said much.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know what he said to you guys.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I haven't heard many of his clips.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously, I don't read the clips, I don't hear them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So his confidence may be a little shaken.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm not quite sure, but he can't lose confidence in himself. \r\nAs a leader, I'm going to give him as much confidence as I can, and I'm going to stay on him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously, I've been a\u2011\u2011 maybe I need to get back on him like I used to do in the past when you guys used to see me really get on him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've kind of laid off of him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Maybe that wasn't the right thing to do. \r\nBut he can't lose confidence in himself.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That is the number one thing, and as teammates, we'll make sure we keep him up.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He said that's kind of where it's going.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He just said that out there.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But at the same time he said that's got nothing to do with the summer, the contract, free agency, what might happen to him, what might happen around here.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you believe that that isn't at least in some way playing some role with what's going on? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, I would hope not, but I'm not Mario Chalmers and I'm not sure what goes through his mind.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, this is the NBA Finals, but also it is his livelihood that he's playing for as well, you know, with him being a free agent this summer.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So I'm not quite sure.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 All I can do as a leader of this team is try to maintain and let him know what the job is at hand.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I understand that he's a point guard on a championship team and we need him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We do.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, he's been key for us throughout these runs.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But obviously right now he's been struggling a lot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But the number one thing is he can't lose confidence in himself.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Before we can give him confidence as a teammate, he has to believe in himself that he can make plays and just be out there and be reliable.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You guys have a must\u2011win game tomorrow.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Are you going to do any special preparation like yoga? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, probably not.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'll follow my same routine.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Get up for morning shootaround and start preparing in the afternoon and get back here and start preparing for the game. \r\nI don't plan on it unless something changes.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Before Game 1 in San Antonio I asked you about the factor of Micky Arison picking a team to come to years ago.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You said the first priority for you was playing with Chris and Dwyane, and then it was looking at Riley and Spoelstra.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you evaluate your future, are you going to prioritize in that kind of order, who I can play with and then from there who is building the team, who is owning the team, et cetera? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know how I'll prioritize it this summer or in the future.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's kind of like on the back burner right now, me figuring out how I'm going to prioritize Tony Parker and Kawhi Leonard and Duncan, and Danny Green and Ginobili, Patty Mills and Boris Diaw and Tiago Splitter, and the list goes on and on, Matt Bonner, Gregg Popovich, and Ime Udoka and those kind of guys.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That is the last thing I'm thinking about right now.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Not prioritize me going into the future.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 In that vein, what defensive adjustments did you guys have to make?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Or was that one of those games that you just got hot and you lived with it? \r\nLeBRON JAMES: Some of it was mental breakdowns, and the mental breakdowns happened early.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Then it was an avalanche, and they started to get hot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Against the Spurs, any little minor mistake you make they'll make you pay.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And when you let them get in such a groove like they had last night, even when you are on top of things, once they got to the groove, there was no slowing them down. \n\n",
  "Q. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0Lebron and Dwayne, was it a lack of effort defensively in the first half or execution? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Oh, they jumped on us, and they were the aggressor tonight, and they had us on our heels from the beginning.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 This is something that at this point in the season shouldn't happen, but they were more aggressive an us and they got off to that 41\u201125 lead at the end of the first.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For both of you, is it more frustration than anger, more anger than frustration?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What is kind of the mood right now collectively? \r\nDWYANE WADE:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 A combination.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Like you said, I mean, they jumped on us early, and that went from \u2011\u2011 to confidence when they didn't miss, and now you're fighting to get back.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Now you're not playing the rhythm in the way you normally play.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You're forcing things. \r\nSo little frustration, but you know that is the nature of the playoffs, man.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's not always good.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 As I told you guys before we start, this time of the year it's dark days for us.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, tonight they came in and took care of business on our home floor, which we're a very good team here, but they're a very good team as well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So we've just got to learn from it and come out in Game 4 and make the adjustment especially early.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How were you guys able to get back into it in the second half?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And what was it like just getting it to a reasonable margin so many times but not being able to finish from there? \r\nDWYANE WADE:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah, we dug ourselves a pretty big hole.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But, you know, we're a resilient team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're going to keep fighting.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I thought third quarter we came out with a lot of energy, the way we'd have loved to start the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Pushed it, got it to like 10. \r\nBut this team they still had a rhythm going, they made plays as a team to not let us get any closer.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But we did what we wanted to do out of the timeout.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We wanted to come out of the first timeout, we wanted to cut the lead, trim it down.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think we got it to 12, 13 the first one.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We cut it within 10 by the end of the quarter, but we couldn't get it as close as we wanted.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They had a good rhythm going.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They made shots. \r\nKawhi Leonard was very aggressive tonight, and they just kept us at bay and they put us away.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 This is for both of you, you have a great defense.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They're averaging 104 points a game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You have a lot of offense, you haven't broken a hundred yet.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is the problem your lackluster defense or is it the problems you're having offensively, lackluster offense? \r\nDWYANE WADE:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The problem is we're down 2 games to 1.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That is the problem.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've got to figure out how to tie it up.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Considering the stakes, is this about as frustrating of a loss you've had this season? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean, of course.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, it's The Finals, so everything is magnified.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You want to win at this point in the season but for us, we will get better from tonight.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We hate the performance that we put on, but it's 2\u20111.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's not 4\u20111.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's 2\u20111, and we have to make some adjustments tomorrow. \r\nWe're going to come in and learn from our mistakes, as we always do after a loss, and get ready and prepared from the beginning.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, this is the last team in the NBA that you can dig yourself a hole against.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You just can't do it, and we learned from that tonight.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Was this one of those games where, was it the defense or where it was like, man, they're hitting everything? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think it was a little bit of everything.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It was a cumulative of everything.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Some possessions we played extremely well and they hit shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Some possessions we weren't quite there and they hit shots as well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 One thing about this team, if you make a mistake, they're going to make you pay, and they made us pay more often than not tonight from some of the mistakes that we made defensively.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you were in such a great rhythm in Game 2.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Really played well in Game 1.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But tonight you committed a Finals record 7 turnovers.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How disappointed were you in your own performance? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I was in a pretty good rhythm tonight as well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just turned the ball over way too much.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I had two at halftime, I had five in the second half, and some of them were trying to make some plays to my teammates, and some of them were just overdribbling at times. \r\nSo I've got to do a better job with that for sure.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's not surprising that I have a Finals record for something I don't want to have, you know, so there we go.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's a new storyline for LeBron.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And for a team that is now in its fourth Finals, how do you explain coming out with such a lack of urgency in a game at home? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't think we had a lack of urgency.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just they were very aggressive and we didn't match that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They came in with a desperation that we just didn't match. \r\nJust because it's our fourth Finals doesn't mean anything.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That doesn't guarantee you a win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It doesn't guarantee you that you'll be more urgent or less urgent than the next team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You just have to prepare for each and every game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've got to have a better performance in Game 4, for sure.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We definitely can't get behind this team like we did tonight.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For the last couple of days guys have talked about trying to pick up Mario and he's talked about it a little bit, too.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 At this point he says he doesn't want to be the reason you guys struggle.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He said that tonight.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 At this point what do you do with him to get him playing or help him to get playing where he's played during the regular season? \r\nDWYANE WADE:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, you know, we're going to continue to give him confidence.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Mario is a big piece of what we do, and we're missing that piece right now, for whatever the reason is.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But as a team, we're going to continue to give him confidence so when he has his shot, shoot it, take it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Defensively, Mario is someone who we depend on to cause havoc, and we need him to do that. \r\nHe's our guy.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's our point guard, you know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously, we've all been to the point where we've struggled before, and we're not going to leave him out on the island at all.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So we're going to continue to pull him in.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It just takes one.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It takes one performance, it takes one shot, and things can turn around.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So as long as he stays confident in himself, he can bounce back from it.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You guys obviously probably don't expect Mario and Norris to have to match Tony and Patty Mills.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But what can you get from those guys to be more consistent in this series?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What do you expect from that position? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, we want them to run the offense and we want them to defend.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When they get open looks, we want them to take them with confidence.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When they have an opportunity, we want them to be aggressive.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously, with Tony and Patty, those guys are very high motors, so we want them to match that effort. \r\nOne thing you can't control in the game of basketball if a shot goes in or not, but you can control how you defend.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You can control how much energy you bring to the game, how much effort you bring to the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If our two point guards do that, we can be okay with that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know our two point guards, they're very passionate.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They've got a lot of pride.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And I know they're looking forward to learning from what they did tonight, and trying to be much better in Game 4.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, it seems like even when they're missing they're getting good, quality looks.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What is it about that offense that's so tough to defend? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, they spread you out.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They have multiple guys that can make plays.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's kind of like us.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They share the ball extremely well, and those guys are always in the right spot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, if they ran the set and closed their eyes, they know exactly where the guys going to be at.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's a system they've been in.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They do a great job of feeling one another out.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And every guy that's on the floor can make a play.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, it's very challenging mentally and physically for a defense.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So you always have to be in tune.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you gave a shoulder shrug after they hit a three midway through the second quarter.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But both of you guys, what is going through your head when the team shoots lights out like that? \r\nDWYANE WADE:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, when they're missing, defense is great.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When they're making shots, your defense is lackluster.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, it's the nature of the beast.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Tonight they shot the ball very well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We helped them early on by giving them rhythm, and they knocked shots down from there.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's things that we've done in previous games.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You contest them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You look and see, Danny Green was 7\u2011for\u20118, but only hit one three.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He got a lot of dribbling and we closed him off the three.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He went to the basket a lot tonight.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Little different than what he's done, but that's the job that we're supposed to do. \r\nNow we've got to figure out a way if they make that adjustment, we have to be aware of it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But it's a hit\u2011or\u2011miss league. \n\n",
  "Q. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0LeBron, for all the heat that you've taken at times for the \"right basketball play\", how rewarding was it that C.B. knocked down that three?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And how did you see that play develop? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It was rewarding in that it was a huge play to help us win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just seen it develop the whole time, and I wanted to try to put some pressure towards the rim, and I caught Tim Duncan peeking at me a little bit.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And I was able to find C.B. in the corner in one of his favorite spots on the floor and he knocked it down. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, because you beat the Spurs in The Finals last year and won two in a row, do you think seeds of doubt creep into their minds, especially late in the game and in the fourth quarter? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's not our concern.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 All we worry about is what we can control and that's just how we play the game, how we approach the game both physically and mentally.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And we live with the results. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What made you decide to take on the scoring duties in the third quarter and what made you not try to win it on your own in the fourth? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just play the game, try to play the game the right way.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 However the flow of the game is going, I just try to impose my will in some kind of way, either scoring or rebounding or assisting or defending.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Put myself and my teammates in a position to succeed, and I was happy in the fact that I was able to make some plays to help us get the victory tonight. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You dressed a little differently tonight than you did in Game No. 1.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you talk about the decision process and how that affected you on the court? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Didn't affect me at all.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've been going with the longer tights throughout the playoffs; decided to go with the shorter ones today.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know, I was watching Game 2 of our Finals appearance versus OKC in 2012, and I didn't have long tights on in that game, so that's why I didn't wear them tonight.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just a little crazy on my part. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How big did the basket look to you?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You hadn't taken a jumpshot until the third quarter.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How big did the basket seem once you started putting that up?\r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For me once I get into a good groove, I feel like everything is going to go in.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously it didn't.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I made a couple of shots in a row, and then missed the elbow jumpshot over Tim, and they made a run after that. \r\n    But for me I just try to make plays out there on the floor, and like I continue to say, put myself and my teammates in a position to succeed and live with the results after that. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, what got you going in the second quarter after your slow start in the first quarter? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just continued to attack.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I had a slow start, but all my misses was in the paint.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 My first miss was a shot over Tim and Tiago; I missed it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I missed a spinning layup in the lane.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I missed a banker over Tony Parker.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just got off to a slow start.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Then I drove the lane and got my foot tangled up a little bit and threw up a wild shot I started 1\u2011for\u20115.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I was confident in where I was getting on the floor and I had to stick with it. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 After those two offensive rebounds in the second quarter how physically drained were you?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It looked like you asked to come out of the game. \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For me, at that point in the game, yeah, I was tired.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I got two offensive rebounds.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Was able to go back up with them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Put some pressure on their defense.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So Spo was very, very consistent and great with his adjustments today as far as the personnel, in and out guys, in and out.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And when I asked to come out, he took me out and I was able to go back in. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, after what you were dealing with the last 48 hours, at what point in the game did you know that your legs were there for you and were going to respond?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And did you do anything else differently to try to make sure you could get through this game? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, I didn't really try to think about it too much.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 One thing I did do differently this morning, I took an 8 a.m. yoga class at our resort that we stayed at outside.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Me, and three other people and also a little kid but he didn't want no parts of it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So that's probably the only thing that I did differently today. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I assume that was not hot yoga. \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Nah, it started to rain a little bit this morning, actually.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 About 8:35 it started to rain. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you were able to come out of the game tonight, how did it feel to have air conditioning? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean, mentally I didn't want to even think about it too much.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What happened on Thursday was Thursday.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 My whole focus was how was it going to help this team even the series up and just try to make some plays. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You dominated from the perimeter in the second half. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0Was that an adjustment you made at halftime from what you saw or did you just take what the defense gave you essentially? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It wasn't an adjustment.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 In the first half, you know, I got into the paint, made some shots, got some rebounds, put pressure on their defense.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 In the second half they backed up off me and I shot it. \r\n    It was that easy for me in the sense of don't overthink it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They give me space, I shoot it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They get up on me, I try to drive and make plays for me and my teammates.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They're going to make adjustments going into Game 3, and I have to do it as well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I don't want to cloud my mind too much with what they're doing defensively.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I want their defense to react to what I'm doing. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 In the last couple of days have you had any fans send any remedies, things to avoid cramps, things of that nature? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've heard it all.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've heard it all.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just stay with my plan.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Our training staff and our medical team, we do a great job of just doing what we usually do. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0We didn't want to complicate things.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think the two and a half bags after a game of IV helped me out a lot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Like I said, I didn't try to think about it too much tonight. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 After Tim and Tony missed those four free throws, you score five straight. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0In a situation like that when a team misses an opportunity, do you smell blood a little bit there?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What were you thinking? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I thought it was a tough call to start it off, with Rio getting the flagrant one.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I thought it was an inadvertent elbow.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I didn't think it was intentional.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So Tony missed two and Tim went up and missed two as well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just wanted to capitalize off their mistakes and just try to put some pressure on their defense. \r\n    We got some great looks, we made 'em tonight.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And the biggest thing for us, we got stops as well when we needed it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That helped us win this game. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You talked the other day about how scrutinized you are and living in this fishbowl that you've lived in for a long time.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What has helped you cope with that, deal with that and live with this altered reality that you have? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've got a great supporting cast around me that allows me to vent at times.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Try not to hold it in.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I also understand at this point in my life what's important and what's not important and what's important is my teammates, what's important is my two kids at home, my wife, my family and my friends.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's what I can control and that's what's important to me. \r\n    Obviously the game of basketball has brought me so much, and I love to play this game at a high level.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And without this game, I wouldn't be who I am today.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I also know what's important.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Everything else kind of just fall by the wayside. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 A lot of your teammates said they have had to learn just not to care what's said about them or criticism or anything like that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you also have to push all that to the side? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You have to.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's very difficult at times, very challenging, but for me, I'm here and I know who I'm playing for and what I'm playing for and what I stand for, not only as a basketball player but as man and as a role model.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know what I stand for. \r\n    To be able to put an NBA uniform on every single night with my name on the back, knowing where I come from, let's me know that I've done something special.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just try to give back to the game as much as I can while I'm here. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you just talk about how big Rashard Lewis was for you guys tonight.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's a player that hasn't played a lot of minutes this season but he's been stepping up big for you guys. \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Rashard has been huge for us ever since he's been inserted into our starting lineup, from the Indiana series. \r\n    He's been in this position before.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's been to the Finals with Orlando Magic.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's been in huge playoff games, and his experience and ability to knock down shots helps us out a lot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It spreads the floor for us, and every time he catches the ball, we tell him just to shoot it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Don't think about nothing else besides shooting the ball, and we live with his results. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Talk about the importance of keeping them out of the paint down the stretch of the game, not only tonight but for the games going forward. \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think that's a key going into any game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When a team lives in the paint, it puts so much pressure on your defense and it allows paint points obviously.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But when guys get into the paint it shrinks the defense, and they get to kick out for their threes, which they did a couple times tonight.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Danny Green had one, Tony hit one, Patty Mills had a couple.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We got to do a better job of shrinking the floor and not allowing them to get in the paint. \r\n    They will, they will get into the paint some, but as much as we can limit the penetration, it will help us out a lot. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What has to continue as a whole offensively and defensively so you can have more success the rest of the way? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Offensively we want to share the ball and not turn the ball over.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're a team that shoots the ball extremely high from the field, very efficient offensively.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We get ourselves in trouble when we turn the ball over.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It doesn't allow us to set our defense.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're a really good half\u2011court defense, we're a solid pick\u2011and\u2011roll defense.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And when we're solid offensively, we don't turn the ball over, we're going to get an opportunity to make something happen. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, Chris missed the corner three on the shot before he made one.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you ever let stuff like that influence your decision and why or why not? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Not at all.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If you're on the floor at that point in time, you can make a play.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You can make a shot, a steal, a rebound.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You can do whatever it takes to help us win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For me, when the ball is in my hands, I'm going to make the right play.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 To have that trust from my teammates, they know when I got the ball, I'm going to make the right play.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Doesn't mean it's going to go in.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Doesn't mean it's going to result in a win, but they believe in my ability to do that. \r\n    You know, C.B. had just missed one, got a great look, but if I draw two and his man leave him again, I went right back to him and he knocked it down.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I got a lot of confidence in my teammates and they got a lot of confidence in me and we live with the results no matter what happens. \r\n    THE MODERATOR:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Thank you.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 \n\n",
  "Q. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0LeBron, do you use today as a day to challenge and kind of test your body after the last game or do you need another day of rest, and we'll just wait to Game 2 to test yourself? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, I'm going to get some work done today, but there is no way to test my body for what I went through.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The conditions are nowhere near extreme as they was, unless I decide to run from here to the hotel, that's the only way I would be able to test my body out. \r\n    But I'm doing well, doing a lot better.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The soreness is starting to get out.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm feeling better than I did yesterday and with another day, I should feel much better tomorrow. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What is your maintenance now consistent of?\r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 A lot of treatment, icing, stretching, obviously I'm going to get some cardio in today, get the heart rate going.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 A lot of fluids, kind of get my body above the curve. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Bike, cardio? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Bike and running. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've had a lot of looks at the Spurs defense in the playoffs over the years.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What is it about their defense that makes it difficult for individuals to put up a lot of points on them? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think Tim Duncan is very good.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Probably one of the best at protecting the rim.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So they're able to funnel a lot of things to him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's able to protect the rim.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 In that sense, very, very smart guy. \r\n    I also think the length that they have had at the wing position helps out as well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Very active with their hands. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0They kind of\u2011\u2011 they want to bait you into taking low\u2011percentage shots, and that's the contested two\u2011point shot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Layups and three\u2011point shots in our league is the number one and two, whatever team you have, as far as the most dangerous.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So they kind of try to bait you into taking shots that maybe out your team's comfort zone. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The TV cameras caught you before Game 1 saying every game has got to be Game 7.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know your approach often doesn't change bought how taxing is it mentally to keep going to that Game 7 well, particularly with this opponent and these stakes? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It can be taxing but at the end of the day, it is what it is at this point.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Two weeks left in the season, then we all can go rest.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Unless some of you guys go off and do baseball or football, whatever the case may be. \r\n    So you have to try to put your mind at mindset and for me I did at Game 1, and for me the tank was empty and I used the reserve tank until my body couldn't go no more.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm going to try to do the same thing on Tuesday.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously I don't want to go too far running my tank out.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I want to be able to finish the game but you have to have that mindset, there is no tomorrow.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But it's challenging, but for a championship you don't want it easy. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Dwyane said yesterday he thinks going longer in the rotation, Spo using more guys would have helped obviously.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 With Rio's foul trouble that may have broke things off a little bit.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you anticipate going nine tomorrow? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Every game is different.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously we could have used that in Game 1.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I thought at times maybe Toney, J.J., U.D. could have gotten some minutes.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Take the load off some of us, but each game is different.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Spo is going to coach the game the way he sees the game going and flowing and we definitely going to ride with that, the way he calls the game. \r\n    And like I said, Thursday's game was extreme measures.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And I don't expect that tomorrow night, but we'll see. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you guys have won your last 12 games after a loss in the playoffs.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you take us inside the locker room?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What changes with you guys coming off a loss?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How is it different?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And how have you been able to be so resilient in that situation? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just think experience.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We have experienced it enough.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously we don't like experience in losses but it happens.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're able to bounce back, go to the film room, take account and not just bypass the mistakes we had in the previous game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And I think it's allowed us to move on and better ourselves for the next game. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, what's your definition of high basketball IQ?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And with everything that goes through your mind, how do you manage it so that you don't overthink it? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, that's the challenge, that's the biggest challenge, having a high basketball IQ because you play so many different situations in your head and so many different\u2011\u2011 I don't know, throughout the game that sometimes it could get into what's really important.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And that's just sometimes going out and letting the game flow and just playing. \r\n    But I think me having a high basketball IQ and I've been told this, that it's allowed me to see things before they happen, put guys in position, kind of read my teammates, knowing who is out of rhythm, who is in rhythm, knowing the score, the time, who has it going on the other end, knowing their likes and dislikes and being able to calibrate all that into a game situation.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's very challenging, but it comes natural, and when you know you have that, it helps your team out a lot. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Have you managed it better over the past few seasons? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, it's grown more and more and more because I've experienced more. \r\n    I've continued to be able to play in meaningful games every year, so that's helped out.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've been able to be around a great group of guys that's helped out, that allowed me to lead them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They trust my leadership, and basketball IQ comes into that leadership.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's helped out a lot having a group of guys that allow me to do it. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, yesterday you called yourself the easiest target in sports.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You're a two\u2011time champion, a four\u2011time MVP.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Why do you think that is? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't think it, I know it. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Why do you think that is? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just am.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Because I've been in front of the camera and the camera has been in front of me since I was 15 years old.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You guys have seen everything from me, from being an adolescent kid just playing the game of basketball because he loves it as a hobby, to now playing as a professional, to succeeding, going to the top, to falling off the mountain, to going up to the top again.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You guys have seen everything that my life has had to offer since I was a 15\u2011year\u2011old kid.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know if Brian Windhorst is in here somewhere, is he?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He could tell you my life story almost better than my mother could (Laughter.)\r\n    So I think that has a lot to do with it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Half of my life I've been in front of this, so it makes me an easy target. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, Game 1 in the fourth quarter, Danny Green caught fire after struggling the first three quarters.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You guys saw what he can do in The Finals last year.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What do you need to do to make sure he doesn't get behind the arc?\r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We just got at that keep our eye on him, we gave him no space last year, every time he caught the ball, he had a guy in his face and he had a guy run him off.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The three threes he made in the first quarter, one was off a drive\u2011and\u2011kick where he got the ball wide open.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The other one was a baseline drive\u2011and\u2011kick from Boris Diaw, where he swung the ball over to the wing and made a three.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And the last was off an out\u2011of\u2011bounds play where they set us up.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He set a cross screen for Diaw and Tim Duncanpinned down on him, and he was able to get a three with no contest. \r\n    A guy like that you can't take an eye off of, you can't take a body off of and take account of where he is outside that three\u2011point line. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Boris Diaw made a good job of contesting your shots last season in The Finals in Game 1.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How important of a match\u2011up is it for you personally? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 This series is not going to be defined by the LeBron\u2011versus\u2011Diaw match\u2011up.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's the Spurs versus the Heat.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Whatever team makes the correct match\u2011up, the adjustments from game to game will win the series. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Talking a little bit about the mental approach after you had your body not do what you want it to in a big game, then you go into the next big game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You mentioned earlier you don't want to run the tank out but you want to go all out.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What's the complicated balance of the mental approach when you're trying to figure out what your body can do and you know it's so important? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, for me and the situation that happened in Game 1 is like you don't know it's going to happen.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously I felt the extreme measures, but I wasn't the only one out there on the floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So you just play and you worry about the results later.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You can't think about what may happen in the third or fourth quarter, live in the moment.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And for me, whatever I can give my teammates if it happens again, hopefully I can make an impact while I'm on the floor and that's all that matters to me. \r\n    I can live with the results.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If I'm giving my all and playing as hard as I can, I'm putting my body and my mind on the line for us to win, you know, for that guy back there in the back, it's all that matters. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is there any danger of getting distracted at all by, how am I feeling right now?

  "Q.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you take us through how much you had to go through the last 12 hours and what your pain and stiffness level is right now? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm pretty sore right now just from the muscles spasming up and they're starting to release, but I'm pretty sore in my legs.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What I went through the last twelve hours was getting up and using the restroom a lot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I got two and a half bags of IV last night right after the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So between 2 a.m. and 11 a.m. I got up about six or seven times.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So obviously I got no sleep. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, the county official that oversees the AT&T Center, he was at the game last night and he said that he thought media reports of the conditions were overstated; that he was actually comfortable.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Put in your words what you thought.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How do I answer this?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They were some extreme conditions.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've never played an NBA game like it was last night as far as the heat.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Not an excuse but it was an extreme condition.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I looked at the stands at one point and I saw every last fan having fans, double entendre, waving fans and I knew at that point, this is something different. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you take us through what you did during the game, how you tried to deal with the heat and when you first started to notice it was affecting your body? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I always hydrate.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Every time I'm out I'm hydrating every timeout, because I know I sweat a lot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I noticed it in warm\u2011ups, and I don't know where it came from, but I felt it get a little warm.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And I actually sat on the scorer's table for 10 minutes and stopped warming up, so I could cool down a little bit. \r\n    I really started to feel it in the second quarter and I never really change my uniform, but at halftime I changed my whole uniform and in the third quarter I came out with I believe eight minutes to go in the third.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And I usually play the whole third quarter, so I knew the conditions was a little extreme for me personally. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you make anything of social media criticism, the chatter, Jonathan Martin, the Gatorade? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm not on social media right now, obviously I hear about it, because I know you guys are going to ask me, so I need to be ready for it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The medical team we have here, man, my training staff and myself we do a great job of preparing for a game. \r\n    What everybody has to say, you guys should know me by now; I don't care, I really don't.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I really don't care what people say about me, I don't care about that sports group, the drink group that\u2011\u2011 I'm not even going to say their name.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm not going to give them a light\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 in The Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 This is about the Spurs and the Heat, and it's not about everybody else, man, I don't care. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you made your last layup, did everything just clenched up right then? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah, just shut down.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 My body just shut down, basically my body said, okay, enough jumping for you for the night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've had enough.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Nothing I could do about it. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, how much anger did you experience last night about not being able to be out there at the end? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For obvious reasons, I was angry, I was disappointed in myself.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, I did everything that I needed to do to prepare for this game, prepare for this moment and, you know, to feel like my body failed me last night, I was angry in the fact that I couldn't help my team get over the hump.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 In a huge Game 1, wanting to make a statement.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 After I made that layup, we was down two. \r\n    So disappointed in myself, angry at myself that I couldn't be out there where I knew my team needed me the most.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That was frustrating for sure. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Will you continue to get IVs?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Are you finished for treatment? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm not done with treatment, but I'm probably done with the IVs right now, unless I catch a cramp sitting around the hotel or tomorrow at practice or something like that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've been very preventative.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 This happened to me a few times.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Happened to me a lot in high school.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I have been tested for it; all the tests came back positive.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So we're always up on it, and stay ahead of the curve, and last night was one of those nights. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Was there a time where you felt like you should have overridden Spo's decision, or was it just impossible to go last night?\r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, Spo knows the best for our team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He has the best interest for our team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And I did want to go back in the game, and he was like, \"Hey, don't even try it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's a long series.\"\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And I respected that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I could have gotten myself into more trouble.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, if I go out there and try to play through a cramp and pull something, it could be even worse. \r\n    I left it at that time and went in and got my treatment, got my IVs and just prepared for Game 2. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you may have just answered this, but have doctors ever told you why you may be more susceptible to cramping and why it happens to you? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, no, they haven't.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've been tested and all the results came back positive, they said just keen doing what you been doing, continue to hydrate.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Continue to do everything you've been doing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It hasn't happened a lot in my career.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's just so happened it happened twice in the NBA Finals and we all remember that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It happened in the OKC series and it happened last night. \r\n    So bad timing on my part, you know, and hopefully it doesn't happen again. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've obviously been educated on the science behind all this since you've been dealing with it since high school, but what exactly is the cause?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Because everyone says hydrate more, drink more water, you've been taking pills or salt tablets.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What seems to help? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The body just decides to shut down.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, I hydrated as much as I could to the point where your stomach feels like it just can't take anymore.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Last night it just got to a point where the body just had enough, just dehydrated.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Between jumping and running and cutting and sweating and a little bit of everything, exhaustion, you know, the body just hit the shutdown.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Nothing that you can do about it, in my case.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, it's frustrating for sure, but nothing I can do about it. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The whole Sterling saga you spoke out very forcefully and early on that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just wondering, what is it that makes you so comfortable also speaking out about\u2011\u2011 willing to voice your opinion on other social issues and things that may be further away from the basketball court?

\r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Four or five years ago, I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Could have been the case.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Maybe I felt like I wasn't mature enough to speak on it, didn't have enough knowledge to speak on it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you become more comfortable with yourself, you start to feel like you can do other things as well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And for me, I speak on issues that I believe is either right or wrong and go from there. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What do you guys feel like you have to do better in Game 2 than last night? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We got to defend the paint a little bit better.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They did a great job of moving us around and through the pick\u2011and\u2011rolls they got buckets in the paint. \r\n    We can't turn the ball over on the road. \r\n    We did a great job of covering the three but loosened up a little bit in the fourth, and it was five out of six from the three\u2011point line.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Danny had two or three, Kawhi had two and Tony had one.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 From our quarter so that would be six, so we've got to do a better job of getting out to their shooters as well, but we will break down the film, and I'll give you a more extensive answer tomorrow. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Last night, do you sometimes feel constrained by the requirements of the products that you endorse, whether it's hydration products or some of the gear you wear?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And that gear, the compression stuff, the body armor, you wear a lot of that stuff.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How essential is it and do you feel like it caused you to retain heat and made things worse? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I actually don't wear a lot of it, I wear a pair of tights, underwear, jersey and shorts, socks and shoes and a headband, arm sleeve.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 (Laughter).\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Compared to my teammate D\u2011Wade, he looks like a football player compared to me. \r\n    I don't really wear a bunch of stuff.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Like I said, we're on top of it, between the training staff and the medical staff we have here and myself, I'll be on top of\r\n    \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's a freak thing, I don't know, when it happens, there is nothing I can do about it, except get hydrated and go from there. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What about the first part, the drinks versus the endorsements.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you feel like you have to stick with the products that you're endorsing or do you feel like you can venture out and do other stuff? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Listen, at the end of the day I'm here to win a championship, you know, and obviously I'm conscious about the things that I endorse, but that's not in the forefront of my mind when I'm trying to win a championship.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Whatever it takes for us to win at this point that's what I'm going to do.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Me being out on the floor, helping our team win throughout crucial moments is more important than anything. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is there any question about your availability on Sunday?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And how far from 100% are you today?

\r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I thought it was weird because it wasn't a full NBA season, and I had gotten used to watching full NBA seasons.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And that's what I started to\u2011\u2011 I love the game, but that's when I really started to get serious with it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So to see, you know, Tim Duncan out there and David Robinson, it was like, win one for David Robinson.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But Tim Duncan was definitely the premiere player out there on the floor and I think it was huge. \r\n    I think it was great when you can as a kid, you watch somebody celebrate and win a championship, you hope that you can put yourself in their shoes.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Not knowing that I would face him in The Finals years later or even\u2011\u2011 this is my third time facing him, so I think it's pretty cool. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know you've talked about how long you want to play and eventually there will come a time where you may not be able to play at the level you want, but could you see yourself changing your game in the way that Tim has changed it as he's gone through the years or do you feel like he hasn't changed it all that much? \r\n    LeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I can.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When Timmy D first started they were more of an inside\u2011out team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think our league was more inside\u2011out.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You would work the ball in the post and if you were doubled, you would kick it out and it was a repost, and they had the team to do it David and Timmy.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think our league has transformed into a pick\u2011and\u2011roll team, an outside\u2011in and if you have the luxury of being able to throw it down in the post, it's like an extra bonus.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For them they have a Hall of Famer to be able to throw it down to when games can get erratic with pick\u2011and\u2011roll and spread offenses. \r\n    I've changed my game since I've got to Miami in the sense that I was probably 75\u201185% pick\u2011and\u2011rolls in Cleveland and after that it was isolation.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Now I'm a third of pick\u2011and\u2011rolls\u2011\u2011 no, I would say 40% post\u2011ups, 40% pick\u2011and\u2011rolls, and not even as much isos.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I would sprinkle it in, and I've changed my game since then and I will change my game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You have to.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Father Time is undefeated. \r\n    So me high flying and doing the things that I'm able to do now at 29.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 At 36 maybe I wouldn't be able to do it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I will change my game again, if I want to continue to be helpful to a team. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, sometimes you hear the people say the Spurs gave it away last year, they should have won it last year.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you guys ever slighted when you hear stuff like that?

\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's a little bit of both.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's also the lineup with myself, Bird, Ray, Rio and Mike, it creates a lot of space.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 With Mike and Ray, they stayed home on those guys a lot, it allows me to get downhill and get to the paint.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I started to be more aggressive, I started to find some cracks and able to finish some. \r\nBut it's a little bit of everything.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Me just trying to be aggressive and put myself in a position where I can succeed to help our team, kind of overcome that 10\u2011point deficit, and I was able to do that. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, when a team loses, especially losing a heartbreaker as the Spurs did last night, you often walk away with the plays still replaying in your head, things that went wrong.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is it the same thing with a win in that fashion?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Were you leaving last night with that replaying? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Absolutely.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I didn't sleep last night either.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The Spurs didn't sleep.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You probably couldn't sleep.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I didn't sleep last night either just thinking about all the plays, the positive plays, the miscues they had, especially for me personally, my turnovers I had late in the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've done that in a few games in the postseason that I'm not too proud about. \r\nSo I was going through a lot of plays and ways that I know what I can't do in Game 7 if we want to win another championship. \r\nSo, you know, everything goes through your mind after a game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's usually the negatives more than the positives. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, have you chosen to accept at this point that no matter if you win one title or a bunch more after last year, criticism is always going to be there and it's always going to be really intense when it comes to you? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah, it is what it is.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's okay.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It won't stop me from loving the game, playing at a high level, doing it for my teammates, putting that uniform on. \r\nFirst of all, I mean, I'm blessed, man.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't even know how I got here.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I wasn't supposed to be in the NBA, if you go by statistics and things of me growing up where I grew up.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Every time I go into my locker room and see the \"James\" on the back of an NBA jersey, I'm like wow, no criticism can deter me from playing this game because of that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm not supposed to be here.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The fact that I'm doing what I'm doing and doing it for my teammates, it's all that matters. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You often speak of your knowledge and appreciation for history of the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There's not many franchises in your lifetime that have gone back to back.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Have you been able to avoid thinking about what that would mean tomorrow night? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I thought about it for sure.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's human nature.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I want to go down as one of the greatest.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I want our team to go down as one of the greatest teams.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And we have an opportunity to do that. \r\nHasn't been many peoples to win back\u2011to\u2011back championships.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's so hard.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's the hardest thing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I said last year it was the hardest thing I've ever done, winning my first.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Last year don't even come close to what we've gone through in this postseason and in these Finals. \r\nSo I'll be there tomorrow night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm going to give it my all.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm going to leave everything on the floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Whatever happens happens.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'll be satisfied with that. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, first off, do you go back to the headband tomorrow or do you leave it?

\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Absolutely.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's the position we're in.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The most important game is Game 6.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We can't worry about a Game 7.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We have to worry about Game 6 and going back home, being confident about our game, being confident about getting a win, which we are. \r\nSo it is what it is.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We have a Game 6 on our home floor. \n\nQ. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0What do you take from your Game 6 experience two years ago that you could use to help your focus and also as motivation? \r\nDWYANE WADE:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean we challenge ourselves to see if we're a better team than we was.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Same position no matter how we got to it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're in the same position going back home with Game 6 on our home floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So we're going to see if we're a better ballclub and if we're better prepared for this moment. \r\nEverything happens for a reason.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And this is not a bad reason at all to go home for Game 6 on your home floor. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He said it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He said it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're going to see if we're a better team than we were our first year together. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, after Game 3 when you guys lost here, you specifically said you had to play better.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You were pretty good tonight.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is this on you?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is this game right now when you go forward\u2011\u2011 anything else you could be doing? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I have to come up big, for sure in Game 6.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I believe we all have to play at a high level in order to keep the series going.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So me being one of the leaders of this team, I do put a lot of pressure on myself to force a Game 7, and I look forward to the challenge. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How do you keep your focus small and not on the legacy of the implications of all of this? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I always kind of focus on the present.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And for us the next challenge is Tuesday night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We will get better tomorrow.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're going to watch film, see ways we can clean up our starts, especially our first quarter.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're not playing well in the first quarter.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We have to figure that out. \r\nBut our next challenge, biggest challenge will be Tuesday night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We have an opportunity on our home floor with our home fans to keep the series going, and we look forward to it. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Dwyane, Spo said that the open looks, especially from Danny Green, are just killing you guys.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Tony Parker was in here and said, \"how is he getting so open this late in the series?\"\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He just doesn't understand it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How is he getting so open? \r\nDWYANE WADE:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, this is the kind of team that I feel capitalizes on any mistake you make.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So if you're half a second late, they capitalize on it. \r\nGive him credit.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's making some hell of a shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's also getting some stuff in transition as well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They're running a lot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And he's the beneficiary of Tony Parker's penetration.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And he's getting some shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But he's making them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Give them credit, man.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's knocking them down.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Not many guys have shot the ball this well, especially in The Finals, that I can remember.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We do have to do a better job like we did in Game 4 of knowing where the shooters are at all times.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He got away from us a few times tonight, and he knocked them down. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, having played with Danny at an early stage in his career, did you ever anticipate that he could do this much damage this late in the series and throughout the series? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean, for me I think opportunity is everything.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Pop gave him an opportunity.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's trying to seize the moment, and he's doing great for his team so far. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you had been asked about why this team has been unable to win two games in a row, and you said, \"Now is the time.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Now is the time.\"\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Why have the Heat been unable to win two games in a row? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If I knew the answer we would have won two games in a row.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just haven't been able to do it. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 This is for both of you guys:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They made adjustments, you made adjustments.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They countered, you guys have countered.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 At this stage how much is it two great teams playing great basketball?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You have to give them credit, they have to give you credit, instead of what's wrong with the Heat or what's wrong with the Spurs? \r\nDWYANE WADE:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think you said it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They're a very great team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're a great team as well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So at this time we're going to make another adjustment.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's going to be very small.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But that's not what's going to win the ballgame.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just like tonight the adjustment they made with throwing more isolations at Tony Parker didn't necessarily win the ballgame but it helped.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It changed things. \r\nSo we have to go back, we have to make adjustments.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But more so than that, it's a lot of mental mistakes we made tonight.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If we make those mistakes in Game 6, it will be the same result.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So we have to be more locked in from start to finish. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron and Dwyane, talk about how important it is for both of you guys to reestablish your individual offense inside the paint in Game 6. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think that's where it starts for us, honestly.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Getting into the paint.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think between the two of us, we probably missed 12 lay\u2011ups tonight.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Transition lay\u2011ups that we usually convert.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I missed a lob.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I missed two lay\u2011ups.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Transition on the same possession.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know D\u2011Wade had a few lay\u2011ups that we're accustomed to making.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Those are points in the paint that we weren't able to convert which we are not worried about.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Those are shots we make.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And maybe it would be a different turnout at that point. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Ray Allen found his shot again in Game 6.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How does that help you in Game 6? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Ray is a big part of our team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So when he's on the floor, he's a threat.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We try to find him. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You both have been in the same position San Antonio is in now, up three wins with one more to go.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you describe those 48 hours before a closeout game, when you know if you win one more game you're the champs?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And conversely, what is it like you know if you lose one more game it's over? \r\nDWYANE WADE:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think obviously you cannot stop yourself from thinking that way, you know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Last year we had opportunity we were up 3\u20111, I couldn't go to sleep that night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 All I thought about was all we have to do is win one more and we're champions. \r\nSo obviously you're going to think that way.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You also have a game to play.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And so I'm sure this team, they've been here before many times.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They understand winning that last game is one of the hardest things you're going to do.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And we understand it as well. \r\nBut you know what, it's the game, we got to play it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I like our chances, just like they like their chances, in this series and in Game 6.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We'll see.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We'll see which team, which style is going to prevail. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think just to piggyback on what he said, it don't matter if you are up, you need one more win or one more win you're out.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You can't sleep.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Especially at this point.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's a great opportunity for both teams.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For them to close this out for them to win it, and for us to force a Game 7. \r\nSo we look forward to the challenge.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've been here before. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0And like you said, we've been on both sides of the fences.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 See what happens, and we got an opportunity to do something special.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And we look forward to it. \n\n",

\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've seen the talent in practice every day.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We would always shoot after practice.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It would be me, him, Mo and Boobie Gibson shooting every day after practice.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I seen his ability to shoot the ball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 In practice he would play very well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just think he needed an opportunity, and I said that before the series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He got a great opportunity here, and he's taking full advantage of it. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, with your ability to recall plays, coverages, that kind of thing, how far does that go back?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When do you remember that beginning to happen for you?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And then how does it help you today either in preparation, practice or in games? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't remember how far goes back.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I can remember plays in situations a couple of years back, a few years back.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes it works great, sometimes it doesn't.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes it can cloud my mind too much and I get to thinking about the game too much instead of just playing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes I'm able to put myself in situations that's better for me and better for our team by knowing what happened before. \r\nI guess it's a gift and a curse. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I guess how far back does the memory go, but at what point in your career do you remember being able to do that?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And do you do it more in practice than in games? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've been kind of like this for a while.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Probably since I was in little league, actually, to be able to remember plays that happened out on the floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But it became important to me probably when I got in high school. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, the game that you and Chris and Dwyane had last game, why hasn't that been more commonplace this season? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I have no idea.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We would love to do what we did last game every game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But every game is different.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Every game presents different challenges.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We haven't been able to string games like that for the Big Three in this postseason.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But we're still here.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're still in a position to win an NBA championship, and that's what's most important. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What has been the biggest challenge of you guys trying to make it work? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think year one, it's just the sacrifice we all had to make. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0That's the biggest challenge.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The sacrifice you have to make to be the face of a franchise, the face of a team and sacrificing everything to be a part of something that's greater.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Once we figured that out, we've been pretty good ever since. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, worst\u2011case scenario obviously is that you go home with home\u2011court advantage on Tuesday night, and theoretically where the series is supposed to be, worst\u2011case scenario.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That all being said, you look at Game 5 as needing the same urgency, the same intensity as Game 4, the same attitude as when you were down in the series? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think it's time.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think we're well overdue when it's time for us to win consecutive games.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think we're at 11 or 12 straight consecutive win\u2011loss, win\u2011loss, win\u2011loss.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think it's time.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Enough is enough for our team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm not saying it's going to result in us having a win, but we need to play with the same sense of urgency as if we were down 2\u20111 or whatever the case may be tomorrow night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And we can't wait around. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Are you surprised at all\u2011\u2011 Game 1 was such a classic, great finish.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously not the way you would have wanted it, of course, but are you surprised that the last three games have all been 19, 30\u2011something, something else that we haven't seen the closer games in this series? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I guess the teams are just making the adjustments.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The adjustments the teams are making from game to game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And that's resulted in what's happened in the last two games.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think that's what everyone would like, 2\u20112 in The Finals for Game 5. \r\nWe are excited about the opportunity.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We have another opportunity to win on someone else's floor. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 A little off the track, it's Father's Day tomorrow.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know Bryce turned six this week, I guess.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Are your kids of the age now that they understand this time of year is different for you?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That the moment is different than the regular season? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, not really.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They don't care either.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They know if I won or lost.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But for the most part, when you have them around, man, it puts everything in perspective.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Like you said, yesterday was Bryce's six birthday.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He had a great time yesterday.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But all they know is if I won or lost.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 At the end of the day I love to see their smiles, love to see their energy, and I'm happy to have them. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So they came out with you for this entire week or just during the weekend? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, they got here Thursday. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, your confidence and your body language and self\u2011assuredness just kind of is completely different now than it was 2011.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just that mindset, how important is that going into a pressure\u2011packed situation like Game 5? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, I think it's just maturity, and if I'm going to be the leader of a team, then I have to be that way.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If the guys are going to believe in me, I can't have doubt.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I can't be unsure about things.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I have to be fully confident, confident in my ability and confident in my teammates and go out there and do it. \r\nSo I got that not only from myself but my teammates have given me the keys and say, hey, we look to you to lead us.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Now it's up to you to go do it. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is that something that you have to just learn by going through the pain? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Absolutely.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Absolutely.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You have to go through some pain.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Doesn't matter if it's at this level or you're a kid or whatever the case may be throughout.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Whatever that you do, I believe you have to go through some pain in order to get to the highest level. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, if you look at the Dallas series, the Oklahoma series and even this series, there seems to be a big difference in Miami's success when you're a perimeter facilitator versus someone who looks to attack and score.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So what are your thoughts on these next three games, to continue attacking?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 As well assuming San Antonio doesn't concede the wide open perimeter, how do you attack in a half\u2011court offense? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What are you asking? \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Basically, I'm asking are you going to continue to look to score? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And not pass? \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean\u2011\u2011\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Let me put it this way:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We don't make it to Dallas, we don't make it to OKC and we don't make it here if I don't play the way I play.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's that simple.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 My game doesn't change no matter who I'm playing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know I'm an attack player.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I also do multiple things.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I get my teammates involved, I rebound, I defend.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't have three straight trips to The Finals if I don't do what I do.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It is what it is. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, your Game 4 turnovers that you forced on them were a little bit different.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And you got into the passing lanes a little bit more.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Does some of that come from the familiarity of playing against a team consistently and starting to understand what they're trying to do and anticipating it? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's about being in the right place at the right time.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Not being too overaggressive, but being in the right places.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We cover for one another.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We got some blocks.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We got some steals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We got some deflections and allowed us to get in transition.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Against a team like this that's very precise with their offense, turnovers are very key.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They're not going to turn the ball over much, but when we do get turnovers, we try to turn them into transition points.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And on the other end we don't want to turn the ball over well because they execute so well. \r\nSo we were in the right place at the right time in Game 4, and hopefully we can put ourselves in the same position in Game 5. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Last year you won the title for the first time.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you watch it sometimes on the tape? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Excuse me? \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Last year you won for the first time you won the title.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you watch it sometimes on the tape on the video? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Last year's Finals? \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yes. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, I haven't watched it in a while.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Been pretty busy as of late.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Haven't had a chance. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, is there any similarities between your performance, mentality, to scout Game 4 this year than in Game 6 last year against the Celtics, that whole mentality being locked in? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I put a lot of pressure on myself coming off the Game 3 loss and I had to own up to that and come through for my team in Game 4.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Like I said, I was blessed to be able to make a few plays to help our team win that game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I have the same focus and the same mentality coming into Game 5.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And we'll see what happens. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Going back to the idea these games haven't been close, do you feel like if you guys play the right way that the three of you guys and you force turnovers and hit outside shots, that you should be able to beat this team, that it's not a surprise when the margins gets lopsided? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're not surprised to get a win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Surprised to win by double digits.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If we play our game, if we force turnovers, we rebound, execute offensively and don't turn the ball over, we can win against anybody.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're a confident bunch.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But we're going against a great team that's going to make adjustments as well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And that's why it's a 2\u20112 series right now. \r\nSo both teams believe they can win on each other's floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Both teams feel like they can beat the other team up pretty well if they get to their game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So it's who gets to their game better that particular night and see what happens after that. \n\n",
  "Q. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0LeBron, could you just elaborate on how tough the Miami Heat are to beat when the Big Three is clicking the way you guys were tonight? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, it was on our shoulders, obviously.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had to figure out to will a game for us, to play at the highest level.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When all three of us are clicking at the same time, we're a very tough team to beat. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you never get the feel of what Dwyane Wade is going to do some nights, it feels like from outside perspective.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you know something about him?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And how he could show up on a night like this, when other nights he just looks like a woozy fighter walking down the court. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, he's a competitor, and every time he's down, he responds.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For him to go out there and play the way he played tonight, it was amazing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 32, 6 boards, 4 assists, 6 steals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The 6 steals let me know he's very active both offensively and defensively. \r\nHe went back in his bag today.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He was Flash tonight.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We needed every bit of it. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is he hurting, do you think, physically? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah, he's hurting.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Of course he's hurting.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's been playing with a bum knee all year.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's hurting, but he's not making no excuses about it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 A performance like tonight will make you feel better. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you talked about how you wanted to get out and run, get rebounds, get out in the open floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You were able to do that pretty much from the beginning.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Did you execute your game plan tonight the way that you wanted to? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had a game plan, and we played well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We played well offensively and defensively, and we needed it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We needed everybody, contributions tonight from the starters to the bench.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We stuck with the game plan, even as they were making their run in the second quarter and some of the runs they made in the third. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, when Spo had to pull you out so you could catch your breath, you looked like you were extremely gassed.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How big of a break did you need right there? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I needed a break a few minutes, for sure.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I gave it everything I had.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I was just playing as hard as I could until the tank was empty.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And that's how it's going to have to be for the rest of this series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I was just trying to keep my foot on the gas, me personally, and just play till, like I said, until the tank was empty.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's why we have guys that can come in, when guys get tired, just keep the momentum going. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you've talked a few times this series about shooters need to see the ball go through the basket.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You saw it go through the basket the first time midway through the first quarter and then kind of took off.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How big was that when Norris Cole hit you with that pass and the bucket and you took off?

  "Q.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, some of the Spurs players were saying that you're not necessarily struggling offensively.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They're just playing great defense.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How much of it is you struggling and how much of it is their defense? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Some of it both.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They're doing a great job of putting bodies in front of me and not allowing me to have some of the creases I have had throughout the playoffs.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Some of it is me being out of rhythm.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's a little bit of both. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you're going through a difficult patch, do you confide in anybody or do you just figure it out yourself? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, I figure it out. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Danny Green mentioned last night, I don't know if you heard it, he said he thought they weren't stopping you as much as you were stopping yourself.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Does any part of that ring true to you that you may be in your own way? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'll be better.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'll be much better tomorrow night. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And what would better mean for you? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Better than last night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I played like (expletive). \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, I know you were upset after the game last night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But do you still have the mindset that it's on you, that you want this on your shoulders, on your chest? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Absolutely.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I take full responsibility for our team's performance last night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Me as a leader, I can't afford to perform like I did last night and expect us to win on the road.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's that simple. \r\nSo I'm putting all the pressure on my chest, on my shoulders to come through for our team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's the way it is. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And when you say that, the obvious thing that I think most people would think about is, is it going to be 40 like Indiana or 45 like Boston?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you afford to think of anything in those sort of terms? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I have to do whatever it takes.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, 7\u2011for\u201121 isn't going to cut it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Zero free throws.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I had 11 rebounds, I had 5 assists, but 7\u2011for\u201121 and zero free throws ain't going to cut it. \r\nSo I will be better tomorrow. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You guys have shown an ability to bounce back consistently this season.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Usually when you do it's in a pretty big way.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is that just a collective mindset of feeling desperation? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've been at our best when I guess our backs are up against the wall.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And we're at it again. \r\nWe'll see how we respond tomorrow. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Dwyane said it has to be the Big Three, so to speak, of Miami to lead this team whereas the Spurs are getting more out of their role players.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you agree with that sentiment?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We have to have a collective group to win, especially against this team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And everyone has to perform at a high level. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, as much as we all know you can take it on, this was supposed to be three great players doing this together in Miami.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The other two aren't really playing that well either.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Are you kind of discounting that they can pick it up? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, I'm not discounting anyone.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We wouldn't be at this point without my teammates.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I have all the confidence in the world in my teammates.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I am the star, I am the leader.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And they look at me to do things on the court, to make plays, and if I'm not doing it, I'm not doing my job. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, obviously you guys have a lot of will and a lot of pride when it goes to responding to losses.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The San Antonio Spurs have four championships, too.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They know what it's like to play in this moment as well. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Absolutely.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We'll see what happens.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Something has to give tomorrow night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They have a championship pedigree.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They have four.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We have two.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So something has to give.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We'll see what happens. \r\nWe've been able to bounce back throughout adverse times throughout the season throughout the years that we've been together, these three years.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We'll see. \n\nQ. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0You said 7\u2011for\u201121 won't cut it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No free throws won't cut it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is it tough to make that kind of adjustment in the game? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You can't have both of them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If you can go 7\u2011for\u201121, but you get to the free\u2011throw line ten\u2011plus times, you're being aggressive.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You have to be able to shoot the ball high clip from the field if you're not going to the free\u2011throw line.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You can't have both. \r\nIt's impossible for me to go 7\u2011for\u201121, shoot 33% from the field and not have free throws.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You have to figure out ways offensively that you can make an impact. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you had by far your best season from the perimeter shooting this year from three and inside the three.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You said you're not in a rhythm right now.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Does the ball feel good coming out of your hands? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 At times it has.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Last night a few of them did.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 A few of them didn't.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I know, I've shot the ball\u2011\u2011 my rhythm, I've been in good rhythm all year.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've worked on it enough. \r\nMentally it's not a problem.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Mentally I'm not out of it, saying that my shot is gone.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know what I can do.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's just about going up there and knocking them down.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I will do that. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, what bothered you most about the team's defensive effort?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And secondly, what has allowed you guys in the playoffs to bounce back with such huge wins after losses? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 19 offensive rebounds, 20 points in transition for the Spurs.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's just something we've grown over the years, being able to bounce back in adverse situations.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And no matter the circumstances, this is going to be probably one of the toughest, because this is\u2011\u2011 like you said, we're going against a team championship DNA and championship pedigree on the floor and a must\u2011win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're going to be ready for it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're going to accept the challenge and see what happens. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, are you more disappointed that you didn't get to the free\u2011throw line, that you were settling, or the fact that their defense is kind of throwing you off your game? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't believe I was settling.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think I took the shots that was there.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I had some really good looks that didn't go down.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I just didn't get to the free\u2011throw line.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I can't allow that to happen.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I have to try to put more pressure on the defense.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Not saying the whistle is going to be blown, putting pressure on their defensive interior and for myself to kick it out for my guys to have to do that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's what I was brought here to do.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And it can't be anything less than that. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you said a number of times that you'll be better and that you will figure it out.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What is it that gives you that confidence to know that that will be the case?

\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, if you see my comments and you see my interview, it'll let you know it was weighing heavily on me, right after getting blown out in a Finals game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So it was weighing heavily on me.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 With my performance, I didn't particularly care for myself at that point in time.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So obviously it was in my head. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you've seen every defense over the years.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've seen teams try to build a wall against you.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But in this particular instance would getting the ball on the move as opposed to a static screen\u2011and\u2011roll be a better way for you to attack the defense? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think that's one way.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Another way is for us to get\u2011\u2011 we have to get stops, too.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And defensive rebounding, where I'm getting the ball off the backboard and trying to create some early offense instead of playing against their half\u2011court defense. \r\nBut, yeah, I may use that adjustment.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Thanks, David.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Appreciate it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 My man. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 One other thing:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Their ability to go from strong to weak passing the ball, moving the ball, is that leading to Leonard being as active as he is on the glass, kind of stretching you guys out a little bit? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's doing something they haven't done this year.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They're 29th in offensive rebounding this year.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And Kawhi has found a way to\u2011\u2011 I think he's made an adjustment to get offensive rebounds.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So it's part of my job, too.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's part of my job, too.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm matched up with him a lot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I get caught sometimes trying to help out our bigs and rebounding.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's coming in flying in \u2011\u2011 when I'm helping out with our bigs, he's coming in and getting rebounds. \r\nI think in Game 2 he had eight offensive rebounds in Game 2.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He had a couple last night as well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's part of my job, too.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm okay with that. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you mentioned you'll figure it out or you always figure it out.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've seen that through the years.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What else have you figured out that you need to do? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Specifically what do you mean? \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You talked about there's getting the ball on the move.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What else have you figured out against their defense that you need to do? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean, I think first of all, I think David said it well, getting the ball on the move.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Get some early offense.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Not playing against their set defense as much.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They're doing a good job of when I come off pick\u2011and\u2011rolls, they have a guy shrink the floor at the elbow and getting a big in front of my body and a guy guarding to pursue the ball as well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They are putting me in a position where they can crowd me a lot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If I can get the ball in transition where I'm facing my defender or maybe just one other defender, I can break their defense down. \r\nBut I will watch film today.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm going to break down the film.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We already watched a lot of film.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm going to break it down some more, and do a better job of attacking their defense tomorrow.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Thanks. \n\n",
  "Q. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0LeBron, you had that great block on Tiago Splitter.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you talk about the play and how you think it affected the game. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just wanted to, I guess, make an impact some way.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Offensively it was a struggle for me; couldn't make a shot, missed lay\u2011ups.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Some things I'm accustomed to making.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So I just wanted to make some plays and try to help our team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And I was able to protect the rim on that one. \r\nBasically I told myself, you'll end up on Sports Center where you're going to get dunked on or you're going to get a block.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Luckily I was on the good side of the Top Ten and the Not So Top Ten. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you spoke after Game 1 about distributing confidence to your teammates, the balance.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You have a game today where you got five guys in double figures.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 A couple of guys with nine points.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Does this maybe show a little bit more of why when people say, why weren't you more assertive, and you said, \"because of what we have\"?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And how comforting was it, while you were struggling to a degree, to have that kind of support system? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I already know what we have here.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Like I said, I don't really read into it of what people want more of me or whatever the case may be.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I will continue to find my shooters, if they're open.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And I will continue to try to put pressure on the defense.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If I draw two, I'll find my shooters.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I have confidence they're going to knock them down.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They did that tonight.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Ray, Mike Miller, Rio made big plays after big plays for us. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You talked about how in that moment you were thinking about, it's going to be a Top Ten play either way.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is the game really that slow for you where in the time Tony makes a pocket pass and Tiago takes one dribble, you can slow the game down that much where you know that one way or another something really good or really bad is going to happen? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Absolutely.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I was, I guess, the last line of defense.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just pride myself on that side of the floor, honestly.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It didn't matter to me.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I was going to try to protect the rim the best way I could. \r\nLike I said, I was fortunate enough that I was able to make a big play for us.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We were able to go down the other end and I think Ray hit a three after that, I believe. \r\nJust being on both sides of the floor, being able to make an impact is what it's all about. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you've talked about how Mario has been aggressive on the pick\u2011and\u2011rolls especially and gone to the basket in a couple of instances today, ending up with and\u2011one situations.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And then he said he had a conversation with you where he said basically let's go for the kill here.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you recount that conversation? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Rio, he has to play big for us in multiple facets.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think that especially defensively he's guarding arguably the best point guard in the league.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I think he also has to make Tony work on the defensive end.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He can't be passive.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He has to attack the paint.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He has to shoot his shots when he has them. \r\nWe started to get a little flow, and I started to see him start to play really well, especially coming off pick\u2011and\u2011rolls.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We ran a lot of pick\u2011and\u2011rolls between the two of us, and I told him to keep attacking and let's try to push this lead up and go for the kill.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And we were able to do that. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, after all the focus on your Game 1, what you did do or didn't do, what your boxscore looked like, your numbers aren't that radically different from Game 1.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You lose Game 1 by four and win this by 19.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What conclusion should we draw out of that? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Whatever conclusion you want.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's a 1\u20111 series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's the only conclusion I know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We look forward to Game 3. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you come in knowing that if you play the same style of game, guys are making shots and the ball is getting distributed, that it's going to go your way more often than not? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What I do know is sharing the ball is contagious, and it allows everyone to feel involved in the offense.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For me personally, I know I attract a lot of attention.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 This team has been set up the right way where when I do attract attention, we have guys that can make plays. \r\nTonight was another case of that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They packed the paint on me.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I seen two bodies, unless I was in transition when I missed a couple of bunnies.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But when I felt like\u2011\u2011 my shooters just need a little bit of room.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Mike showed that, Ray showed that and Rio showed that tonight. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 On a night like this when you're not as efficient as you normally are and you're not as in rhythm and not even getting to the free\u2011throw line, take us into your mindset as you try to kind of figure out the game and get your own game going, how you did that. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Now offensively if I'm not in the rhythm, you need to make a couple of plays to make an impact.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's what you're on the floor for.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You need to do it on both sides of the floor, however you can do it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think what helped me was the late third quarter pocket pass from Rio, I was able to get a lay\u2011up.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Then I came out in the fourth, I was able to make an elbow jumper.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And then I made some plays defensively to try to help.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I made some defensive rebounds.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I was able to get the block on Tiago, and then my shooters finished some shots I was able to get them in transition. \r\nYou know, that's just part of my game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When I'm not scoring or I'm not as efficient offensively where I feel like I'm missing some shots, I just figure out ways that I can still help the team, even if it's not scoring as much. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Did you feel you were controlling the game even at that point before you kind of got a little rhythm? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, honestly for me, when I was struggling offensively, my teammates continue to keep it in range.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And we even had a lead at one point.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Especially late in the second quarter when we made that run and I was struggling a little bit. \r\nSo I think Rio more than anybody kept us aggressive, him getting into the paint, him getting those and\u2011ones and making a couple of threes.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It allowed me to sit back and wait for my time. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, one of your shooters, Mike Miller, seemed to be kind of everywhere defensively, had that little flip pass also over to you.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How much sort of a refreshing boost has he been?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Because he seems to have a whole lot of energy. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We want him on the floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 As teammates, we want him on the floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We know what he brings.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's a 6'7\", 6'8\" two guard/small forward that can shoot the ball from anywhere and can rebound at a high clip.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 With the lineup we had in the late third to the fourth, me, Rio, Ray, Bird and Mike it spreads the floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It spreads the floor for our attackers. \r\nWhen Mike gets the ball\u2011\u2011 our shooters got the fluorescent light on our team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They're not even allowed to pass.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When Ray and Mike get the ball, they have to shoot it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No matter how close the defenders are, they have to shoot it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you have that leeway and that confidence, you just have to let it go. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You talked about the rosters of both teams and how they're built to complement the Big Threes.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How much is that supporting cast for both sides going to impact this series moving forward? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, it's key.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The Big Three I guess on both sides.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, you can kind of rely on them at all times.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I think the supporting cast is really why both teams are here.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They've been making an impact all year long, and they feel like their supporting cast is better.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We feel like our supporting cast is better.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's who goes out and do it each and every night to help seal wins. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, what is your take on the 2\u20113\u20112 format?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And do you look at it as no big deal now playing three straight in San Antonio?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Because you guys historically have been so good on the road. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I really don't\u2011\u2011 it doesn't matter.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Two best teams in the NBA at this point.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Both teams have won and can win on each other's floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So it's not a biggie. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know how much you love discussing injuries, but you had a wrap on your knee tonight that was noticeable.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is that a new thing? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I got a floor burn in Game 1.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Instead of the band\u2011aid, I wrapped it so the band\u2011aid won't fall off. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's a condition, not an injury? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I am okay.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Don't worry about me (laughing). \n\n",
  "Q. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0LeBron, based on the 2\u20113\u20112 format in the Game 1 loss, how important is a victory in Game 2? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, at the end of the day it's a Finals game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Every game is important.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Game 1, Game 2, 3, 4, no matter 2\u20113\u20112 format or it could be a 3\u20112\u20112 format.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No matter what the format is, it's The Finals; every game is important.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's the playoffs, actually.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Every game is important, no matter if you're at home or on the road. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So no extra sense of urgency? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean, I think the importance of a game, the urgency should already be there.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's what playoff basketball is all about.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You can't afford to, you know, not play with a sense of urgency in a playoff game. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Fourth quarters in the playoffs probably take more out of you than regular\u2011season games, of course.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How can you find another gear, not just you, but the collective you in the fourth quarter of some of these playoff games? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We have to dig down.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's about will.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're a team that expends a lot of energy on both sides of the floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But we have to figure out a way to have some in the fourth quarter for sure, when it's closing time. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, how much of that is just maybe getting Dwyane\u2011\u2011 he was talking about how he didn't wear down because of the knee.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He just said he was less aggressive in the second half than he was in the first.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How much of that is just giving him maybe one or two easy ones and sort of seeing everything open up for everyone? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think it's more important for him than anyone on our team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Then CB and probably me would be last as far as getting him an easy one, seeing the ball going in and pick up his aggressiveness.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you're a scorer, the best thing for you to do is to get an easy one, a dunk or a lay\u2011up, and it makes the game much easier for you.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, is there a different style of basketball when you play a Western Conference team that may take a game or two to get used to or is that overrated? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, I think each team is different.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You have to game plan each team differently.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's going to take a game, maybe two, to get rhythm of things.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The Milwaukee series was different from the Chicago series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The Chicago series was different from the Indiana series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And now this Spurs team is going to be different from all three of those teams. \r\nIt's just the personnel, how it works, how the coaches prepare those teams.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's a little bit of everything.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And then each round gets harder and harder, too. \r\nSo it takes a couple of games, more preparation in the films and in the books, to get to a point where you are comfortable with everything that's going on out on the floor, both offensively and defensively, and the ways you can exploit those challenges. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, what do you expect from your teammates in Game 2? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I expect them to suit up and be on the floor and ready for a game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's what I expect out of them. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I guess before Game 1 you said this is 2013 and you can't make me do what I don't want to do.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And then yesterday you talked about Game 1.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You kind of suggested they made you pass more.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You said you like your passes, but you suggested you could be more aggressive.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Did they make youdo something maybe you didn't want to do? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I was waiting for one of you guys this year, the literal journalists. \r\nNo, when I decide to pass, I feel like as a teammate hoping I can make a play.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Offensively I attract so much attention that if a guy is open on my team, I will pass the ball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And the Spurs did a good job of shrinking the floor and not making me pass the ball, but I've seen guys that were open. \r\nSo if that's their game plan, we're going to continue to exploit that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And I believe our guys will be there to knock those shots down.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But it's also a few plays I could have been more aggressive as well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But Game 1, I think I improve as the series goes on as well, seeing ways I can be more aggressive from possession to procession on in the series. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No one has played more minutes than you the last three postseasons, plus Olympics.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What kind of toll has that taken on you? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, I would love to have rest, but not at this time of the year.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I wouldn't substitute sitting down in my house right now watching The Finals. \r\nIt is what it is.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's a toll.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's a toll for myself to go through what I've been through the last two\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half years.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I've been blessed, I've been blessed to be able to be in three Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've been blessed to be a part of a great Olympic team and to play basketball, the game that I love.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm not going to be able to do it forever.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The opportunities that the game has given me the last couple of years, I wouldn't substitute that for rest. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, of all the teams that you've faced with this Miami team in the postseason, how does this San Antonio team compare to all the other tests you've had? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's a tough test.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's going to be a tough test for us.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I think we've had some tough tests in our three years.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I thought Dallas was\u2011\u2011 Dallas beat us and they were very tough.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They were very smart.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They were a veteran ballclub.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They had some great players.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I thought some of the Chicago series that we've had, even though we've won 4\u20111 against them in both our playoff series, those were some tests.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've had some challenges. \r\nOklahoma City gave us a scare a little bit in Game 1 of last year's Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But we were able to figure that out.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've had some pretty good battles, and I think\u2011\u2011 let me not forget this, being down 3\u20112 going into Boston last year.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think that was a huge test for us, too.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For them to come here and they beat us in Game 5, and we had to go out and beat two in a row just to advance.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So we've had some pretty good tests and we've been able to overcome. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Secondly, a lot of people when they watch you in a game where your team falls short, maybe you don't score at the end. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I should have done more, right? \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Should have done more.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Triple\u2011double not quite enough for you. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Right. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you hear that, do you think, I need to be more aggressive or do you know you need to be more aggressive? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, I can't get involved in that honestly, because I've done more and lost before.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, we played Orlando\u2011\u2011 when I was in Cleveland we played Orlando in the Eastern Conference Finals and I think I averaged 38\u2011\u2011 36, or whatever I averaged.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I guess I should have done more in that series as well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I can't. \r\nI can't really get involved or care\u2011\u2011 I don't really read too much.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know what I say to you guys and I know the questions you guys ask me, but I don't really read too much of what people say.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I do what's best for the team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What's best for the team, it doesn't always result in a win. \r\nI wish we could go 16\u20110 in the playoffs.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That would be awesome.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There's challenges that come from the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You learn from game to game in ways that you can get better.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I want to win just as bad as anyone.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm going to put myself and my team in a position to win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I have to try to make the plays.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I can't worry about if people are saying, you should have done more, you should have been more aggressive, because you got a loss.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Winning and losing is part of the game. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, how does the Danny Green that you saw in Cleveland compare to the Danny Green you saw in Game 1? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is that a serious question? \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yes.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How have you seen his game grow? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think, first of all, opportunity.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's what it's about in this league.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's about a coach believing in you, giving you the opportunity.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And it's about your teammates believing in you and giving you the confidence, and then about yourself just going out and doing it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think it's the same thing with Paul George and the same thing with Danny Green on different levels because Paul George gets more of a burden offensively from his team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But Frank Vogel gave Paul George the keys this year, and allowed him to grow and his teammates gave him confidence and he started believing in himself.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And I think that's what Pop about with Danny. \r\nIn practice Danny would play well for us, but he was behind some veteran guys, myself and Sasha Pavlovic and Delonte West and Mo Williams and Boobie Gibson.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It was very tough for him to get on the floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Also being a rookie too.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I've seen the talent he had.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He showed the talent when he was in North Carolina.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Once he got to Pop, Pop gave him confidence.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You get the opportunity, you go out and make the most of it. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You were saying earlier about trying to get Dwyane some easier opportunities and get him into the flow.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Your teammates were talking about how it's not so much about Dwyane's health game to game but just his energy level.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 In addition to getting him easy opportunities, are there conversations you have with him to make sure that he's continuing to fight through it the way he needs to fight through it? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What I tell D\u2011Wade is when he's most in tune with the game, I can see it on his face.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think his face just shows where he's at in the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know if it's maybe his knee or maybe frustrated at times or maybe he's just not in the rhythm.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I can see it on his face when he's there.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's what I told him, even if sometimes you're not in the rhythm, I need to see your face that you're in tune and you're ready for the next possession and ready to move on from whatever is going on. \r\nFor me as one of the leaders of the team who has the ball in his hands a lot, I have to do my part as well to help them, I guess, get that face, where he feels like he's involved, and where he feels like he's a part of everything that's going on, both offensively and defensively.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And it helps us out.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When his energy level is high, his motor is going and his face is\u2011\u2011 he feels like, he looks like he's in tune, we're a really, really powerful team. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, I wonder about the 24, 48 hours after a playoff loss and how the team responds to that, how the coaches respond to that, specifically in terms of the adjustments that you make from game to game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How receptive they are to things that you may suggest and how on point they are with the adjustments that they make from game to game. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, there's pros and cons with having 48 hours in between games, especially after a loss.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You think about it a lot and it eats away at you.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But at the same time it allows you to really pinpoint ways you can get better in the next game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had yesterday, we had today, and we will also use tomorrow, shootaround to continue to, I guess, get more familiar with what the game plan will be tomorrow. \r\nSo the time definitely helps.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And the communication, like you said, the communication between the players and the coaches has to be receptive and open and honest in order for the game plan to work, because we have to have everyone on page from the coaching staff to the players once we get on the floor because the game is kind of so fast. \nI think it's been great for us, these last I don't know how many hours it's been since Game 1.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But we've used the time, I think, wisely in this case. \nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you recall the most brutal film session after a playoff loss that was just really bad? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've had a couple.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've had a couple where, you know, the players didn't like the coaches.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Coaches didn't like the players.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And I think that's very healthy.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It happens.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The coaches want the players to do everything right, and sometimes the players want to do it or believe that they're doing everything right. \r\nSo we've had film sessions where we both left out of it, I guess, not liking each other, but agreeing on what happened and owning it and seeing the ways we can get it better in the next game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And it usually happens during the playoffs. \r\nI think everything is just magnified.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's more emotions, more everything in the playoffs.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For a veteran ballclub, we shouldn't sugarcoat anything when it comes to wanting to get better and improving. \n\n",
  "Q.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you guys are 4\u20114 in your last eight, which is kind of unusual with the runs you guys have been on through the season.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously a terrific series against the Pacers.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you guys feel you've dropped off from some of the great runs you have had?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And is there any reason that there was unbelievable efficiency at some times during the season and now not as much?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Or is it just the opponents? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, I think as the rounds go on and on, the opponents and the teams that you're facing become better, and we know that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've been able to get better as well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're in the NBA Finals, we can't worry about we're 4\u20114 in the last eight games.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're in the NBA Finals and we have to try to make the most of it. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, Kawhi Leonard thinks you could come out more assertive in Game 2.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you think there's going to be times in this series where you're going to have to, maybe as you phrased it a week or two, go back to your Cleveland days? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I play every game\u2011\u2011 I don't really predetermine what I'm going to do.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I kind of let the game flow for itself.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We'll see what happens. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 To follow up, can you just talk about your general fatigue level now?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And how much does it take out of a player when you've got to work on the boards so hard as you did, 18 rebounds the other night? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It is tough.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But it is what it is.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I put myself in a position to try to do everything for this team, a little bit of everything, and put myself in a position to win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's very challenging mentally, physically.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But you have to figure out a way to just have will at this point of the season.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There's not too many days left.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There's no room for excuses. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you've gone through it three times, four times now, losing Game 1s.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The first three times you won in five every time.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When so much spotlight is on you guys, so much pressure on you guys this time of year, why do you make it look so easy to overcome these 0\u20111 deficits? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's not easy for sure.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's definitely not going to be easy versus this team we're going against now.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But we've been able to get better.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've been able to make adjustments going from one game to the next.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We kind of just bounce back after a loss.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No matter if it's on the road or at home.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've been able to bounce back. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, Tony Parker played 39 1/2 minutes last night without a turnover.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Erik just called him clever.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What makes him so smart? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's been in this position multiple times.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's a very, very smart player.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 High\u2011engine player.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think it's very unique for him not to have any turnovers last night versus our defense.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think Pop\u2011\u2011 they've been on the same page for so many years, they know the system more than anybody. \r\nHe does a great job of running their offense and putting himself and putting those guys in position to succeed. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, their strategy to kind of load up the paint on you and force you to maybe make a pass when you get in\u2011\u2011 I know you've seen that before, but as you watch or review it, are there things you can do to counter that? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I had some more opportunities where I could have maybe been a little more aggressive or look for my shot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I don't to take away from any plays I made last night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I was able to still find my guys for some shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We missed some shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had some wide\u2011open clips where I had two defenders guarding me.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Two plays in the third quarter I was able to find Rio for two open threes that he just missed, two great shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I found CB for four really good looks that he missed, that he's capable of making. \r\nMy guys are open.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've got this far with them, I'm not going to just abandon what I've been doing all year to help us get to this point.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So I know those guys will be ready to shoot again once they're open. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, Erik was talking about whatever it takes.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously that's where we're at in this point of the season.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What kind of appreciation do you have though for what D\u2011Wade is going through trying to get ready, getting the uncertainty that he has to deal with? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It was a tough situation.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He spends countless hours of treatment and whatever you can do to try to just prepare for one game each and every night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've never been in that position, so I can feel for him, but I can't really understand exactly what he's going through.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You appreciate when someone like that puts their body on the line each and every night when they're not even close to 100%. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you've taken on the challenge of guarding Rondo in past playoffs.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You took on Tony late in the game last night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How much of the game is it realistic for you to go head to head with him and guard him?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And what are the pluses and minuses of asking you to take on that challenge for more than just a few possessions at a time? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think the game will present whatever the game presents itself, opportunities for me to guard Tony.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If it's early in the game, late in the game, it won't be the full game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think we have confidence in our two point guards.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There will be times where I match up against him. \r\nSo defensively he does a lot of running, comes off a lot of pick\u2011and\u2011rolls.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So I have to be ready for that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Offensively it presents a little challenge for me once I get back on the other end, chasing after Tony and going through all the screens that he goes through.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I'm ready for it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm ready for the challenge.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's something I live for. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, maybe besides the missed shots, what was your review of your fourth quarter offensive execution last night?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And maybe what are some of the things that needs to be done? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We just had some very empty possessions where we didn't get to anything.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Got to some random sets and we had a couple of turnovers that we're not really accustomed to having.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We played a very efficient game, but in the fourth quarter we kind of got a little sloppy when we're usually really good. \r\nSo we watched film today.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We watched an hour of film, an hour and a half of film.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We know where we can get better and be better in Game 2. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, Erik came in and talked about how one of the most important priorities going forward is to get Chris more touches in the paint.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What do you think about that?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And how difficult will that be?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And do you need him to go down there more often? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It won't be difficult.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think if he accepts the challenge to want to put pressure in the paint, he'll have it. \r\nWe run our offense through CB mostly.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I get a few sets, but I get a lot of mine off of rebounding, defensive rebounding and D\u2011Wade gets a few sets.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Mostly our offense goes through Chris, either in the elbow action or we run situations where D\u2011Wade will come off a flare and CB's manwill drop and help, and CB gets that action where he catches the ball at the elbow. \r\nWherever CB demands the ball in the post, we'll give it to him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We love when CB comes out because we know he's being aggressive.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We need that paint attack from him. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Did their defense dictate that you play distributor last night or was that a conscious decision?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And will you make that type of decision in Game 2? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They shrunk the floor a lot and they put five, four, at times they triple\u2011teamed me in the post.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do the math.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If I have three guys on me, four against three or four against two on the back side.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So guys are open, and I believe in my teammates that they're going to make the right play after that. \r\nMy job is to draw attention from those guys.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Once they get the ball, they can be in attack mode or do what they need to do to help our team. \r\nEvery game presents different challenges.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm not sure what the game plan they'll have tomorrow.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It may change.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I knowSunday, I know we're going to make adjustments as well going into Game 2.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We'll see.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We'll see what type of game plan I come out with on Sunday.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It will be dumb of me to reveal it today. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, Coach said he used the word \"painful\" when watching the film for the fourth quarter.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What word would you use to describe watching the film of the fourth quarter?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And you said that you can get better in the fourth.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What are those areas where you can? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously, we had some empty possessions where we didn't get into any of our sets.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had a few turnovers which\u2011\u2011 some of them were just unforced.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We can't have unforced turnovers, especially in The Finals, especially versus a very good Spurs team that's going to come up the other end and execute really well. \r\nIt was painful.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's always tough watching a playoff loss and see how many mistakes you made.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But that's what you learn for.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's the good thing about this team, we own it and we watch it and then we try not to make the same mistake the next time. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, one last tough memory:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That Parker shot, has that run through your mind since?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And is there anything you would have done differently? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, I mean I've seen it today on film.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But it didn't run through my mind too much after the game last night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It was a tough shot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He came off a pick\u2011and\u2011roll.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He bobbled it, he backed up, he tripped, he fell and he got up and went under my arm and made a tough bank shot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's not why we lost the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's a huge shot, but it's not why we lost the game. \r\nNo, didn't really bother me too much. \n\n",
  "Q. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0LeBron, can you take us through Tony's last play and that final possession. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It was tough.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You're going to make me go back to that play?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Tony did everything wrong and did everything right in the same possession.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He stumbled two or three times, he fell over, and when he fell over, I was like, okay, I'm going to have to tie this ball up.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He got up and went under my arm.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I got a great contest, and he even double\u2011pumped it and barely got it off.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That was the longest 24 seconds that I've been a part of. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 2\u20113\u20112 format is always tough when you lose one of those first two at home.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You guys experienced that a couple of years ago.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How does that change your mindset as you go forward? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It is what it is.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's a seven\u2011game series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, we got to see ways we can get better for Game 2.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We can only focus on the next game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's what it's about. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What did the Spurs do to you defensively?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Did they try to force you to become a distributor? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, yeah.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They did a good job of putting two guys on the ball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When I got the ball, they kind of shrunk the floor and set a guy at the elbow and dared me to pass the ball. \r\nI know my guys will be there to knock those shots down the next game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had some really good looks, especially in the third quarter.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Rio had some very good looks.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It just didn't go down. \r\nThey did a good job tonight. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, I guess along the same lines, it looked like in the fourth quarter you weren't getting a whole lot of help.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Did it seem that way? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had our chances to win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We go into the fourth quarter with a three\u2011point lead.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So we had our chances.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had five turnovers in the fourth.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We gave them some offensive rebounds in the fourth as well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And Tim Duncan had one putback; Kawhi Leonard had another one.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We can't allow that. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you guys obviously made the adjustment.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You ended up on Tony Parker in the crunchtime situation.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You always talk about how you guys present a pick\u2011your\u2011poison type situation to other teams.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is this a team that you guys have to look at it that way? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah, against this team you can't make many mistakes.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You look at statistics, you know, we put in ourselves in position to win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They shot 31%.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We outrebounded them by 9.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had more assists.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But we turned the ball over five times in the fourth. \r\nI was looking at the stat sheet.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It says they had 21 second\u2011chance points.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't really understand how is that possible with only six offensive rebounds.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm very good at math, and the only way you can get a second\u2011chance point is if you get off a rebound.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Am I correct?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Even if you hit a three, six offensive rebounds, that's still 18 points.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't understand how that works. \r\nBut we had chances.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's kind of weird.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't understand this.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Am I right or am I wrong?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Am I right?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Okay.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's crazy. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you talked yesterday about how you have a much better team than in 2007 when you faced the Spurs.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How do the Spurs compare?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do they look like the same old Spurs even though their Big Three are six years older or what? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The Spurs are the Spurs.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They're going to put you in positions where you feel uncomfortable offensively and defensively.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And every time you make a mistake, they're going to capitalize on it. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, I asked Erik about you and Dwyane sitting to start the fourth.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He said both of you needed a minute.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you go to him or did he go to you? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I told him I needed one.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 At that point I had played the whole third.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I had been accustomed to being able to start the fourth.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But the third quarter was so\u2011\u2011 I was in the paint, defensive rebounding, I was closing out Kawhi Leonard on shooters.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It took all in the tank from me in the third quarter.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So I needed a little breather. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, when Dwyane came in, he said that the Heat looked a little bit like a fatigued team that had played a seven\u2011game series in the fourth quarter.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Was that in part the difference in this game tonight? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The fourth quarter was the difference.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I can see it on a few of our guys' faces.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Felt a little fatigued, still a little banged up from that seven\u2011game series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They looked like they were rested in the fourth quarter.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They took advantage of that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had some mental mistakes, and we played some really good basketball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But in the closing quarter we had some mental mistakes.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And it's only a couple of teams you can't have mistakes against, especially in the fourth.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And San Antonio is definitely the number one team. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you guys often talk about how in these three years together you have seen and experienced absolutely everything at this point.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you rely on that right now to get through the next couple of days and not let this one loss overshadow what could be coming up? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's the first team to four.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They came in and beat us on our own floor in Game 1.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know they're going to be hungry to try to get two.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So we have to be able to combat that and come back with a Game 2 plan that's better than Game 1 and even the series. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you had 18 points on 16 field\u2011goal attempts.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How do you get that offensive efficiency up? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, I missed some shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I missed some really good looks.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 As far as being efficient, I'm not worried about that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I also had 18 rebounds and 10 assists as well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So you know, I'm not too much worried about what I do as far as scoring. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, three times before this loss your team went down 1\u20110 in a series, and in all of those times you won.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 In fact, you've won every game in the series after that point.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you think back to Oklahoma City last year and Chicago this year, do you remember the team changing in intensity and focus in any way?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Why has that happened in the past and can it happen this year? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think one thing about our team we've gotten better as the series went on.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We hate to lose before we start to get a little edge, but that's what happens.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We'll see if we can continue to repeat what we've been doing in the series, being down, and come back on Sunday with a\u2011\u2011 like I say, with a better game plan, you know, and try to even the series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 \n\n",
  "Q. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0LeBron, obviously it took a lot of stress and also gave you a lot of satisfaction to get your first championship.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For your legacy, what would it mean to get multiple? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't play this game for my legacy.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I play the game because I love it and I have fun playing it, and I love the competitive side of it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Once I'm done, I don't\u2011\u2011 you guys will write my legacy and say what I've done for this game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But that's not for me to worry about right now. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How about what it would mean to get the second one? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's what I play the game for, is to win championships.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I understand that it's a long process, it's the most difficult thing I've ever had to do playing basketball. \r\nThat's what I'm here for.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm here to win championships, and you're not always going to be on the successful side.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've seen it twice, not being on the successful side.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 To be able to just put myself in the position to be able to play for one, I'm happy with that. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, how will the 2013 version of LeBron James be different from the 2007 version that the Spurs faced in The Finals? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just smarter.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 A lot smarter.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 More experienced.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Older.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 More mature both on and off the floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And I think that's the most important thing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've matured as a basketball player.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've matured as a man.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And it has allowed my game to sprout. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We watched you on ESPN all day yesterday when Duncan and you kind of met in the hallway there.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's kind of a cool moment.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But when you\u2011\u2011\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's cool for you guys.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It wasn't cool for me. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What was it like when you go back to that and you see that and even watch film of that series? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's been a while since I've seen the series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm pretty good with going back on my mental about what happened.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It was tough.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We ran against a team that was more superior, more experienced, more better\u2011\u2011 that's not even a word\u2011\u2011 better than we were at the time.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And they took advantage of every miscue, inexperience thing that we did on the floor. \r\nThat allowed them to raise the Larry O'Brien Trophy. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you have any get\u2011back in you for 2007 going into the series? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, it's a great opportunity.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I have something in me that they took in '07; beat us on our home floor, celebrated on our home floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I won't forget that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You shouldn't as a competitor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You should never forget that. \r\nIt's the same group of guys, for the most part.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The same Big Three, and Coach Pop.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And I look forward to the challenge once again. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, can you talk about winning and losing and how losing can fuel you a little more in this kind of situation? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I've lost enough.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't need any more fuel from losing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've lost two Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So I don't need any more fuel from losing The Finals. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 To follow that up, when you look at the San Antonio Spurs, they're pretty old.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, they actually make you guys look kind of young.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you feel that?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You guys are the young team coming in.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You guys have been in the league for a long time. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, there's not any young teams in this.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's the two best, experienced, well\u2011coached teams in The Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They're in The Finals for a reason:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For their experience, how well they're coached, how balanced they are, and their championship DNA.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There's no advantages. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, every series takes on its own life.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously the Pacers a more physical team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The Spurs a little bit different.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you see this as a series where maybe Dwyane and Chris can break out of their funk a little more.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Maybe better match\u2011ups or more conducive to their styles? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's what we hope.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We don't know until the series gets started.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Every team we play causes different problems.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 From Milwaukee to Chicago to Indiana and now San Antonio.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So we don't actually know until the series begin. \r\nWhat we do know is how we're going to play.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're going to play our game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're going to share the ball. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0We're going to attack, try to get to the free\u2011throw line.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And with that attack, myself, D\u2011Wade, CB are the key ingredients to that attack. \r\nThey don't need to put no pressure on themselves.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 These guys have been to The Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 D\u2011Wade has two rings.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 CB has one.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've been in this position before.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They know how to play. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, so when Tim had those words after that '07 series, was it hard for you to appreciate it at the time because you were still in competitive mode or did you appreciate he had nice words for you? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, it's however you take it, honestly.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He had just won and I just lost.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I didn't remember too much about it until I seen the footage once again.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I appreciate having an opportunity to go against a great team and just use that as motivation to get me better. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is it hard for athletes to say \"this team was better than us\"?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Because a lot of guys when they lose a Finals say, we did this wrong, this wrong.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You right from the start said, \"We couldn't have beaten them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They were better.\"\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is that difficult to do? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, it's obvious.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The team beat you 4\u20110, are you going to say, \"They weren't better than us?\"\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It was obvious.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They were a better team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They were more experienced.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Like I said, they took advantage of all the miscues we had. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, Tim Duncan's numbers this season are almost identical to what they were in 2007.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What do you think it is about Tim Duncan that has allowed him to be so relevant at 37 and to maintain such a high level of his playing? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 First, I think it's him staying in shape, his conditioning level.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think it's the great support that they have in San Antonio.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Also I think it's him being a true professional to the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Giving everything to the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And when you give everything to the game, the game rewards you.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And I think it's all of that. \r\nHe's a champion.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He has championship DNA.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And like I said, when you give everything to the game, as far as, you know, sacrifices that you make, the game repays you.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It has allowed him to continue to play at a high level, even at his age. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, to that end, as a student of NBA history, how do you think Tim will ultimately be regarded in this era as one of the players of this era?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How do you think he'll be viewed? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Who? \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Tim. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Probably one of the best players to ever play the game of basketball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If I just look at the last 15 years, he's probably been the most consistent, most dominant player that we've had as far as 15 years all together.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's won four titles, multiple All Stars, MVP, and so on and so on. \r\nI think He doesn't get a lot of recognition because he's not flashy like a lot of guys are.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's not jumping over people and high\u2011flying and doing the things that attracts people to the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I think true basketball, true IQ people, players know how great he is.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What else can you say? \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, have you ever watched a Spurs game throughout your career and then gone back to your team that you're playing on at the time and say, we need to do that? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, yeah.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Absolutely.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just think the one thing that you kind of always seen, no matter what, they've always shared the ball and played as a team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's winning basketball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's something I've always kind of been taught throughout my whole life, especially when I was a kid, moving the ball, and everybody feeling important.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If you move the defense from side to side, something is going to open up for you.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You always see the Spurs doing that. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What situation do you prefer, to have a rest for nine days and to have a good rest, and to have a rest just for two days but to keep the pace, the winning pace? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm ready to play now.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I would rather have the two days. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you talked about how much smarter you are compared to the 2007 Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But on the court, your jumpshot, are you more confident now?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And the improvement since then, how does that affect how they guard you this time around? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think in '07 they kept\u2011\u2011 when I got the ball, they kept me on the sideline.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They went under a lot of my pick\u2011and\u2011rolls and dared me to shoot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Back in '07 I ran a lot of pick\u2011and\u2011rolls.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They funneled me to the sideline with Duncan and Oberto and Bruce Bowen and Michael Finley and those guys funneled me to the sideline and dared me to shoot it, and didn't allow me to get to the paint where I did most of my damage back in '07. \r\nIf you go into my pick\u2011and\u2011roll now, I'm going to shoot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And I'm confident I'm going to make every last one of them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm just more confident in my ability to shoot the ball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But at the same time, I also have a lot more weapons this time around going against this team, where in '07 they loaded three guys to me a lot on the strong side of the floor. \r\nSo like I said, I'm a better player, AND you can't dare me to do anything I don't want to do in 2013. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, this year the challenge is going to be on Kawhi Leonard to try to defend you.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you talk about him as a player offensively and defensively, what he brings to that team and your match\u2011up. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think he brings athleticism to their front court.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He brings a guy who can guard multiple positions with his length, with his wingspan and his ability to get out in transition and finish.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And also shoot threes in the corner, brings a dynamic to their team that they didn't have before they got him, and Danny Green. \r\nI had Danny in Cleveland with me as my rook, so this is going to be great to go against him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm happy for what he's been able to do.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm looking forward to the challenge.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, I've played\u2011\u2011 I have had every pretty much good defender that has to offer in these playoffs, from Mbah a Moute to Jimmy Butler to Paul George and now Kawhi Leonard. \r\nSo it doesn't change for me.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm looking forward to the challenge.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I also play both sides of the floor as well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm not just an offensive player.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I play defense as well. \r\nNot only will I attack my defender on offense, I will attack my offensive player defensively. \r\nTHE MODERATOR:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Thanks, LeBron. \n\n",

  "Q. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0After everything, you've had about an hour to soak it in.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know that isn't a whole lot of time, but after all the times you've thought about what this moment feels like, was it better, was it what you envisioned?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's everything and more.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, I dreamed about this opportunity and this moment for a long time, including last night, including today.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, my dream has become a reality now, and it's the best feeling I ever had. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've spoken so much about growing as a player and growing as a person over the last year.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you think where you are in your life now makes it even that much more special, and is there a pride that it wasn't just growth as a basketball player, but that you're in a better place as a person to really enjoy it now?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Absolutely, you said it perfect.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The fact that I have a family, a fianc\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a9e, two kids, supporting cast, supporting family, allows me\u2011\u2011 it took me to go all the way to the top and then hit rock bottom basically to realize what I needed to do as a professional athlete and as a person.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, I'm just happy that I was able to be put back in this position.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I trusted my instincts, I trusted my habits that I built over the years, and I just got back to just being myself, and I didn't care too much about what anyone said about me.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just kind of made my own path, but did it the right way, and I'm happy I was able to do it the right way and do it for myself and not for anyone else. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 On the podium I thought you said something interesting:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You said that the worst thing that you heard last year was that you're selfish because you've always prided yourself on being a team player.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Could you maybe elaborate on that more, hearing that, and how that fueled you. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, I heard it a lot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Last year I let it affect me.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I told you guys over and over and over, I was playing to prove people wrong last year, and people would say I was selfish, and that got to me.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That got to me a lot because I know that this is a team game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know the coaches that I had when I was younger always preached about team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There's no \"I\" in team, and to win a championship, no matter on which level, you have to do it as a team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 A lot of people were saying I was a selfish person and a selfish player, it got to me.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 All last year I tried to prove people wrong, prove you guys wrong, and it wasn't me.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 At the end of the day, I was basically fighting against myself. \r\nThe best thing that happened to me last year was us losing The Finals, you know, and me playing the way I played, it was the best thing to ever happen to me in my career because basically I got back to the basics.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It humbled me.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I knew what it was going to have to take, and I was going to have to change as a basketball player, and I was going to have to change as a person to get what I wanted. \r\nYou know, it happened just one year later. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 In hindsight do you think that your journey to a title eight years later was just the natural growing pains of a player in the league, and maybe we judged you too early and your journey turned out to be almost like Michael's or Isiah's or Dirk Nowitzki's, where they had to wait a while?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It was a journey for myself.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't want to compare it to any other player, but it was definitely a journey.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Everything that went along with me being a high school prodigy when I was 16 and on the cover of Sports Illustrated, to being drafted and having to be the face of a franchise, everything that came with it, I had to deal with and I had to learn through it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No one had went through that journey, so I had to learn on my own.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 All the ups and downs, everything that came along with it, I had to basically figure it out on my own. \r\nYou know, I'm happy now that eight years later, nine years later since I've been drafted that I can finally say that I'm a champion, and I did it the right way.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I didn't shortcut anything.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, I put a lot of hard work and dedication in it, and hard work pays off.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's a great moment for myself. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 At times you make it look very easy on the court.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How hard was this to win a championship? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It was the hardest thing I've ever done as a basketball player, since I picked up a basketball when I was nine years old.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's the hardest thing I ever done.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's not easy at all.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You just put a lot of hard work into it, and hopefully one day you hope that it pays off for you.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, this was a testament to that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I gave it my all, and it paid off for me tonight. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Right after the final whistle we saw you hugging and talking to Kevin Durant.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What were you talking about?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And do you actually feel like the No.1 player in the world right now?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think Kevin Durant is a hell of a player, one of the best players that we have in this league, hands down.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I basically told him I was proud of him, everything he achieved this year.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, he's going to use this experience, like I used it, as motivation.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Hopefully I don't continue to have to run into him because he's that great.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's one of the best, on and off the court. \r\nIn the summertime we worked out together.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I envisioned it, but I didn't know it was going to happen, but to see a few months later that we was going to meet each other in The Finals, it was a great moment for myself and for him. \r\nBut as far as your second question, I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's for you guys to write, to say if I'm the best player in the league or the No.1 player in the league.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 All I know is I'm a champion, and that's all that matters. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 This question isn't intended to bait you or intended as some negative question, but what would you say to the Cleveland fans tonight that wanted to share this moment with you, wanted to win this championship with you?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What words would you offer them? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, right here I'm sitting here as a member of the Miami Heat.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The hard work and dedication that we put in these last two years to get to this point, I mean, it was unbelievable.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I wanted to become a champion someday.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I didn't know exactly when it would happen, but I put in a lot of hard work. \r\nFor me, I'm happy.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm very excited.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm very happy right now to be a champion.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Nobody can take that away from me. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you give us your thoughts on the Thunder.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And you've been there, do you have any suggestions for KD or any of that group as to what it will take to reach that next step? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, first of all, I think it's a great team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Like I said before, we're the two best teams in The Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They create some unbelievable matchup problems with their attack, Russ and KD and James, and they have Ibaka the shotblocker, the phenomenal presence of Perkins and the list goes on.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Collison is a big\u2011time player, as well. \r\nSo they're going to be a team to be reckoned with for a lot of years because they're young, and they're going to use this experience as motivation.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, this is not the last time we'll see the Oklahoma City.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I wouldn't be surprised\u2011\u2011 this won't be the last time we see them in The Finals. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I wanted to ask you, your journey has taken you to very highs and very lows.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What have you learned about yourself as a ballplayer and as a man through your journey to the championship? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The biggest thing I learned is that you can't control what people say about you, what people think about you.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You just have to be true to yourself and true to the people that surround you and your loved ones.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, like I said, I put a lot of hard work into this.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I took one week\u2011\u2011 I took, I think, one and a half, maybe two weeks off after we lost the NBA Finals, and I just got in the gym and I got back to the basics. \r\nIt just shows when you're committed and you give everything to the game, the game pays off and it gives back to you. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Does it make it any more special that you were able to do this in such a condensed season, 66 games, regular season games in four months, back to back to backs?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It must have gotten real tiring for you.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Does that make it even more special that it was so frenetic? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, condensed schedule, 66 games, 82 games, shoot, we could have played one regular season game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Hey, man, I'm NBA champion, and it don't matter. \r\nLove you guys. \n\n",
  "Q. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0Can you take us through the last 24 hours of treatment, where you stand with the cramps, what you were able to do today, and how you think you'll be able to do tomorrow? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I feel a lot better than I did last night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's clear.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm able to walk up here even better than I did last night when I talked to you guys.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm still a little more because of the muscles just kind of being at an intense level, very tight.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm still sore.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I was able to get some treatment last night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I was able to get some treatment this morning. \r\nWe prepared for Game 5 a little bit today.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We didn't do very much running and things of that nature, but I think I'm going to used today as an opportunity to continue to improve with my legs.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And also with the game being basically at midnight tomorrow night, I have all day tomorrow, too, to prepare.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I should be fine by tomorrow night. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Going back even to like the summer, you've talked about different approach, focus, mindset, all of those things, and throughout the postseason you haven't changed the approach one bit.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How much more difficult will that be for you the next 36 hours?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And also, do you have any idea what you're going to say?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We hear some of the huddles obviously.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you have any idea what you're going to say to guys tomorrow night?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, my approach won't change and it won't be difficult.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I have a job to do, and my job is not done.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, I've been very focused, and I'm determined for us to play at a high level.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So I will make sure my guys are ready for Game 5, and we will be prepared.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Coach Spo and the coaching staff will give us a great game plan.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And I'll make sure myself and my teammates are ready to execute it. \r\nI have no idea what I'll say before we go out there.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It kind of just comes to me when I'm getting ready to go out there and stand on the floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But hopefully whatever I say will inspire our guys to go out and give a good show. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Where did the reading program come from and what has that done for you throughout this Playoffs?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It just slows my mind down.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It just gives me another outlet.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Throughout the Playoffs, all you think about is basketball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 All you want to do is play basketball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But at the same time it can become a lot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It can become to a point where it's overloading to the mind, and you think about it too much.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's hard to get away from it because you're playing every other day, you talk about it every single day, you prepare every single day.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So being able to\u2011\u2011 the reading has gave me an opportunity to justfor those couple hours of the day or those 20 minutes, 25 minutes before the game, just gives me an opportunity just to read and think about something else, and get a sense of what else is going on besides the game of basketball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's made me comfortable.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm not saying it's the trick.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's just something that I decided to do at the beginning of the postseason, and it's worked for me. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I wonder if you can just indulge a couple of bad Finals memories here for a second.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What do you recall about 2007, and what do you remember about your feelings sitting there on that podium around this time last year after Game 6?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't remember too much of 2007.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know I was young and inexperienced.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 As a team we was inexperienced, and we ran into a San Antonio Spurs team who had already won, I think, three of them to that point, and they had been in that moment, and they showed it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So they kind of\u2011\u2011 in Game 3 I think we had an opportunity to win that game, but after that game they kind of put us to bed in Game 4.\r\nLast year after Game 6, after losing, once again, I was very frustrated.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I was very hurt that I let my teammates down, and I was very immature.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Like I said, last year I played to prove people wrong instead of just playing my game, instead of just going out and having fun and playing a game that I grew up loving and why I fell in love with the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So I was very immature last year after Game 6 towards you guys and towards everyone that was watching.\r\nOne thing that I learned, and someone taught me this, the greatest teacher you can have in life is experience.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've experienced some things in my long but short career, and I'm able to make it better of myself throughout these Playoffs and throughout this whole year, and that's on and off the court. \r\nI'm just happy that I'm able to be in this position today and be back in this stage where I can do the things that I can do to make this team proud, make this organization proud, and we'll see what happens. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So much talk about you and KD kind of mano\u2011a\u2011mano, and most people are saying you've gotten the best of him so far.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you see it that way?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 At the end of the day, coming into this series, this\u2011\u2011 you know, I'm a historian of the game and I love the history of the game, so coming into this series, this reminded me of \u2011\u2011 I wasn't able to watch it live, but I know the history of the game, so it reminded me of the '91 Finals of the Bulls and the Lakers.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The whole world was so excited to finally see Michael Jordan versus Magic Johnson in The Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They didn't really care about the Lakers and the Bulls going against one another, it was all about Magic and Jordan. \r\nThat's what it was about coming into this series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, everyone was excited to finally get an opportunity to see two of the best players go head to head, myself and KD, but for me personally, it's not a head\u2011to\u2011head battle.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When I go out on the floor, I do want to dominate the guy in front of me, but this is a team game, and I have all the trust in my teammates, and I try to do everything that needs to be done individually to help our team win. \r\nI really don't get involved into the head\u2011to\u2011head battle as far as outside the lines of the basketball court. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You talked about the things that you wanted to do better after last year, and one of the things you did was go to Houston.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Have you heard from Hakeem recently about your progress in the post, and when you look back at what you did at that point, do you see it manifesting now?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah, I've talked to him three times since the postseason started.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He asked me if I've been watching the film.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He tells me to continue to do what I've been doing and continue\u2011\u2011 staying in the post will get you easy buckets, and he also tells me to continue to have fun.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's the thing he noticed with me this year.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's seen me have a lot of fun, and I give a lot of thanks to him for allowing me to go down there and work with him for that week, and instill a part of my game that I felt like needed to be worked, and I was happy that I was able to go and join him and get work on it.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Erik was saying last night that a lot of things that you guys have done in the last week or two are not things that he thinks you guys as a team could have done last year, everyone of course armchair\u2011analyzes you on that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I wanted to ask you what you think.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you think that you would have been able to come in, cramping, make that shot, that three\u2011pointer and sort of have the mental focus to do that last year? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know because I wasn't in that position to be cramping, I guess, in Game 4.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I didn't make enough plays in Game 4 last year, I'll tell you that. \r\nLike I said before the series started and before this postseason started, I wanted to make game\u2011changing plays because that's who I am, and that's what separates me from a lot of players, that I try to go out there and make game\u2011changing plays every single game, plays that may seem out of reach or may seem out of range, I try to make those plays.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I didn't do that last year in The Finals, and that's what stuck with me more than anything. \r\nLike I said last night when I talked to you guys, I'm happy that I was able to be in a position last night even with the limited mobility that I had, I was able to be in a position to make a game\u2011changing play from that three. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When have you felt that pressure most through these Playoffs?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The pressure?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I haven't really felt it that much.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Last year it was much more than it is today.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I remember being Game 5 last year with the series tied 2\u20112, it just felt more pressure, felt like it was more people here, felt like you guys not only brought yourselves but brought your relatives all into Dallas.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It just seemed more. \r\nAnd I may be wrong.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I probably am wrong about that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I'm just more comfortable.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think just me being more comfortable and me just trying to seize an opportunity.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 This is my third crack at it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 First of all, I'm blessed because a lot of people, first of all, never go to The Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Second of all, if they go, they never go back.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And this is my third opportunity.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So I'm just trying to make the most of it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And like I said, win, lose or draw, I'm giving my all, and I'm going to be happy.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'll be satisfied with that. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You kind of just mentioned it, but you had these two opportunities.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What does it feel like now in the moment right now to be one game away?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And what do you think of the challenge of getting it done? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For me I'm not\u2011\u2011 I haven't even really looked at it as just one game away.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I look at it as this is our next game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 As crazy as it sounds, I haven't got caught up in it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I won't get caught up in it because I'm not going to let\u2011\u2011 you know, the human nature is to automatically think about after we win it, what are we going to do.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm not there.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I won't get there until those zeros hit and I see that we won.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm the leader of this team, and I'm not comfortable right now.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm comfortable in my game, but I'm not going to be comfortable until we seal this thing. \r\nGame 5 is a Game 7 for us, you know, and it's a must\u2011win for them, but it's a must\u2011win for us, too, and as a leader of this team, I'll approach it that way, and hopefully I won't have to be dealing with cramps tomorrow night.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You said you're not really feeling pressure, but do you have to shut anything down as far as phones or friends or family, because while you're trying to stay in the moment other people may not be?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah, they've already been\u2011\u2011 since the postseason started everyone has been shut down.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They understand what I've been going through over the years.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 My family has just been allowing me to just play the game and not worry about everything else that's going on.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They wouldn't dare get in my way at this point. \n\n",
  "Q. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0There were so many moments this year when you were Westbrook having to score close to 40, those kind of games to carry your team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How good did it feel tonight when you look at the boxscore, see 25 from Dwyane, 25 from Mario, Chris a rebound from a double\u2011double?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How satisfying is it for you to have a team victory in a game like this?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's a big\u2011time team win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We needed everyone's effort, and everyone came up and made a play.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, from the starters to Rio's spectacular game, to Norris, as well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We was down in that first quarter, Norris came in and gave us a spark, hit a couple threes, got into the lane, got a lay\u2011up and made some plays to kind of help us get into a rhythm. \r\nYou know, it's a big\u2011time team win, and we needed every point, we needed every rebound and everything that everyone had to get it. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Two things:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 First, can you sort of update us on how you're feeling, how you're doing right now?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm feeling a lot better.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm feeling good.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We'll see how I feel tomorrow, too.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Has it hit you that you're one win away at this point?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you afford to think about it in those terms, or can you not think about it in those terms?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, of course it's there to think about, but I'm not taking our preparation for Game 5 for granted.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're going to prepare the same way we've been preparing all series, and if we play Miami Heat basketball, we give ourselves a good chance to win. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What did it feel like?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And have you ever experienced anything like that before?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah, yeah, I have.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What did it feel like?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, you have to play sports and get a cramp before to understand the feeling.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's basically like your body just shuts down, your legs shut down on you, there's nothing really you can do about it. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How do you block that pain out, I guess, for that three\u2011pointer there with under three minutes to go? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, the ball was swung to me, and the shot clock was going down.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just wanted to step up and try to make a play.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, and I was able to drain that three and give us a lift.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I was just trying to make a play.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If I was out on the floor, I wanted to try to make a play with the limited mobility I had at that time, and I was happy I was able to come through. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you just talk about the resiliency of this team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've battled back from playoff deficits, you've not had Bosh.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Tonight the guys stepped up when you were out.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just talk about that overall, and now you're one game away from a title. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, for us we're a complete team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 A lot of people don't understand that about our team, and they always just focus on myself or D\u2011Wade and CB.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But everyone's effort, all the hard work everyone puts into it makes us a complete team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We need that performance from everyone.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, we understand it, myself and D\u2011Wade and CB get a lot of the press, but without all the sacrifices and all the commitments from the other guys, we wouldn't be in this position.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How frustrating, first of all, was it for you to not be out there in the final minute of the game? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It was very frustrating because I'm a competitor, and I want to be out there to help my team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But like I said, it's a team game, and that's why we have those other guys out there that's going to make plays, even if I'm not available or someone else is not available.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's what it's been for us all season and all Playoffs.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When someone goes down for any reason, guys step up.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know you're a student of the game, you know the history of this game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When I saw you come out there, it reminded me of Willis Reed stepping out for the Knicks more than 40 years ago.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Did you think you were in the middle of something special hitting that three\u2011pointer?\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I did want to come out.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Like I said, I sat on the bench, got rehydrated as much as I could while we had a long time\u2011out, and sat through a few plays and I was able to go back into the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Like I said, I'm happy I was able to make a play, make a big shot in a big game, and my teammates were able to close it from there. \nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Could you talk about Russell Westbrook's game tonight and what you expect from them when they face being closed out on Thursday. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 This is the second time we've seen a performance like that from a great point guard.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The first one was Rajon Rondo when he had that spectacular game against us.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think that was Game 2, if I'm not mistaken, of last series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, so many great point guards in this league today, Rondo and Westbrook and Derrick Rose and Chris Paul, these guys can do wonderful things, and Westbrook gave it his all, shot the ball extremely well, and he came out from the gate. \r\nI think they hit their first three or four shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He was in attack mode, and you get a couple lay\u2011ups, his jumper started falling.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He gave them an opportunity to win this game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And at the same time it just shows that we can still win those games.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If someone has a spectacular game against us, we're still able to find a way to win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But he had a hell of a game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He had a big\u2011time game. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You're one home W away from a ring. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0Do you start thinking about it?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you fathom this already? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, tomorrow we're going to prepare for Game 5.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've got to prepare like we've prepared all series and all season.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, Coach Spo and the coaching staff has given us a great game plan.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There's some things they can change, that we can correct.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Like I said, if we come out with the mindset that we've come out with during the Playoffs, we're going to give ourselves a good chance to win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's all we can ask for. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You were guarded by Thabo Sefolosha most of the time.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What do you think about this matchup and Sefolosha's defense?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think Sefolosha is a very active defender.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's wiry, he's strong down in the post at times, but he has quick hands, he has long arms, so you can't play with the ball around him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I enjoy the match\u2011up.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I enjoy whoever they put on me, and I just try to thrive and make plays for our team. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Erik said basically at the end that he decided he couldn't play four\u2011on\u2011five at that stage because you couldn't give much more.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Did you fight him on that?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And when you had cramps before, what do you do between now and the next game?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, I didn't fight him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I caught the cramps the one time, and tried to get some liquids in me, get rehydrated and went back in, and it happened again at that point.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I knew I probably wasn't going to be able to finish the game. \r\nI didn't fight them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I didn't fight anything at that point.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just put the faith in my teammates, which I understand.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've got a lot of faith in them, and I love them for the way they played tonight. \nBetween now and Game 5, just try to rehydrate.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I lost a lot tonight, but I will be ready.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'll be ready for Game 5, and hopefully I can stay hydrated where it doesn't happen again. \nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've talked about what you want to do to get back into the game after you got to the bench with your cramps, but what was going through your mind right when you hit the ground and then had to be carried off the court? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I knew I wasn't injured.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just knew I had cramps.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've had it before.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Your muscles basically just lock up on you, so I tried to walk, but they wasn't letting me move.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So our trainer, Jay, and Juwan came out and assisted me to the bench.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I wanted to walk to the bench, but my legs wouldn't allow me. \r\nBut I've been there before.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've had cramps before, like I said, and it's not a pleasant feeling.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I'm happy that we've got a great training staff, a great organization, and they helped me get back on my feet.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I was able to walk up here and talk to you guys. \n\n",
  "Q. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0If you go back to the Indiana series, you got Danny Granger in foul trouble, you got Paul Pierce in foul trouble and now you're getting Kevin Durant in foul trouble.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you look at it and see the best player on their team guarding you, do you have a special focus of trying to get him in foul trouble?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, because that can take away from what you're trying to accomplish offensively.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm just being aggressive.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, whoever is in front of me, I just try to put pressure on him, no matter if it's KD or Harden or Sefolosha or whoever is guarding me.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I try to put pressure on their defense for myself and my teammates. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What was the moment like when Dwyane came up to you and did confirm or tell you that this was your team?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And how did that help you in your approach on the court? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, for me, I just try to be a leader, out on the floor, in the locker room, and do whatever it takes for us to win basketball games.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, at the end of the day, they look at me to make plays.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They look at me to lead them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I'm not the only leader of this team, D Wade is also a leader.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Udonis is also a leader.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Chris is a leader.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Shane is a leader.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Everyone has leader aspects in their game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But they just look at me, and when they look at me and they need something done and they need a play in a big game, I try to make it happen to the best of my ability. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Did that conversation surprise you or were you expecting it, or did it even need to be said?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He told you how that conversation happened? \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, it was reported.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know the exact conversation. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That never happened.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 (Smiling). \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The three you made late in the third and then the lanes to the rim sort of reopened again in the fourth.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is that coincidence, or did you guys need one to fall to switch things back up?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We didn't have many perimeter shots that fell for us last night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, it was a big shot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We rode that wave that we had.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We was down 10, and we was able to go on a huge run, and it capped off with me making that three in the corner putting us up by two, and we was able to take that two\u2011point lead going into the fourth. \r\nYou know, Shane is our key guy right now, our only guy that's making perimeter shots, and even a few shots that we make from the outside, it opens it up for all of us because they have to respect the fact that we can make some shots outside the three\u2011point line or from the perimeter, and once that happened, then our attackers, myself, D Wade, CB, Rio at times, can make plays to get into the paint. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Dwyane was up here and Erik was up here saying that neither team might get to their best game this series because of the defense and the quality of the opposition.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You guys have won a lot of games ugly this season and ugly in these Playoffs.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is that something that's to your benefit that you can win a gritty and grimy game if you have to?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Are you fine with that, if America doesn't see the greatness of the Heat, but if you get four, are you good with that?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't give a damn how we get four.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We can win 32\u201131.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It doesn't matter to me.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We can win any type of game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We can win a gritty game, a high\u2011paced game, but we take every game as its own.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We don't go into a game saying this is what type of a game it's going to be.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We going into a game saying this is how we're going to play.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're going to be aggressive, we're going to try to control the rebounding, have low turnovers, and we're going to try to get some good shots up, and try to get to the free\u2011throw line.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And at the end of the day, if we play to our identity like Spo always preaches to us, then we'll give ourselves a good chance to win. \r\nYeah, I don't care how we get four. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you talk about Pat Riley's presence on this team, what he means to you as a team and what he means to you individually and the way you go about the game. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, for us as a team, he means a lot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, he put together this team, and we just look at his r\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a9sum\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a9.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We look at his experience either as a player, as a coach or as an executive.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's done some great things. \r\nYou know, me knowing the history of the game, he's been around great players.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's been around Hall of Fame players and guys who have won championships, so any insight that he gives you, he's giving it because of experience.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He knows all about it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's won at the highest level multiple times.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, it's great to have him around and just hear those stories about some of the greatest players to ever play this game like Magic and Kareem, Worthy.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's amazing.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What are some of the biggest changes in the relationship between you and Erik Spoelstra from the first month of the first season here to right now?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's trust.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I didn't know him, he didn't know me our first month together.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And now we're still growing each and every day, but our trust factor is great.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, he trusts me on the floor to do things, you know, and that's great.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 As a player, you feel confident when your coach allows you to make changes on the fly, and I have the utmost respect for him for allowing me to have that responsibility, where if I see something on the floor, I can just go with it, and I know I'm doing it for the best of the team, and he gives me that leeway.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So trust is the number one thing. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Bob McAdoo was talking about when he joined the Heat he talked about he had to finally join the Lakers to win a title and what have you.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What kind of advice did he help you through that process?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously you got a lot of people that didn't like the way you came down to Miami and what have you. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, the biggest thing is he made a sacrifice to join that team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You look at Doo's r\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a9sum\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a9 before he joined the Lakers, he was multiple MVP, multiple scoring champion, he could score with the best of them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I think he knew that if he was going to be joining the Lakers, he wasn't going to be that same player.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So he had to make sacrifices. \r\nNow, I'm not saying that's me because I still have to play at a high level and Doo came off the bench for that Laker team, but I think sacrifice is the word I'm trying to say.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He had to make a sacrifice for the better of the team to win a championship. \r\nLike I say, you talk about Pat Riley, you talk about Bob McAdoo who's done so many great things in this league, it's always good to have them around and just get that word from them because they experienced it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The best teacher that you can have in life is experience, so it's great to have them.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Does that show in a way that even back then you had to kind of collect superstars, no matter how you did it, versus a little bit like\u2011\u2011\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Listen, I know the history of the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've got to have superstars and stars to win a championship.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've got to have a great coaching staff and a great organization.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But as many as Jordan won, he had a great supporting cast around him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 As many as Bird won, he had a supporting cast.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 As many as Magic won, he had a supporting cast, same with Duncan.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I understand that you can't do it by yourself.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've got to have guys around you, great players around you, then you've got to have role players, you've got to have a great coaching staff and a great organization and put it all together. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 With this lineup you're most often at least the second biggest guy on the floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Have you had to change your mindset because of that?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And is that a reason you've had such success in the paint even going back to the Indiana series?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah, I had to change my mindset.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I had to change it when Chris got hurt, that was a big part of our team, going out with an injury.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He put a lot of pressure on the rim.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And when he got hurt, he got an and\u2011one dunk.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So I understood I had to change my approach both offensively and defensively.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I had to rebound more, I had to attack more, get into the paint more to make up the difference with Chris being until he got back.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just had to change, and it's kind of stayed that way since he got back.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've kept that now, and is that a reason for the success, for example, last night in the paint especially?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I try to\u2011\u2011 I do a little bit of everything.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I was able to have some success in the paint off either\u2011\u2011 in the post game or off cuts or off pick\u2011and\u2011rolls.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I tried to do a little bit of everything.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Last night they gave me the lane, I was able to get a couple offensive rebounds and get some put\u2011backs.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Then the second half I was able to come off some pick\u2011and\u2011rolls and get to the lane and make a few lay\u2011ups. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Would you say that being up 2\u20111 in The Finals last year and then seeing it unravel stuck with you in the weeks and months following?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah, of course it stuck with us, all the way to this day.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But we're a totally different team than we was last year when we was up 2\u20111.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're a totally different team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We understand what it takes to win, and we've used that motivation, and we will continue to use that motivation. \r\nBut last year is last year, and we're not going into a Game 4 on someone else's floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're going into a Game 4 on our floor with a lot of experience in this type of situation.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We'll be ready.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We love the challenge. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Fouls and free throws were critical last night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Coach Spo was talking about avoiding fouls being a key.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you address that, and your ability at times to avoid fouls? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I'm not much of a fouler, personally.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Our team, coming into the series, knowing Oklahoma City had shot\u2011\u2011 coming into the series they shot 90 percent from the free\u2011throw line.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So as many attack guys as they have and as well as they score the ball, you can't allow them to not only make tough shots, then also put them on the free\u2011throw line.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You can't give up both. \r\nSo we just try to make them take tough shots without fouling.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 KD is a great free\u2011throw shooter, Westbrook is a great free\u2011throw shooter, and Harden knows how to attack guys.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're just trying to do our best.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're trying to keep our hands away from contact, contest without fouling.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And if they're going to make a contested jump shot or a contested lay\u2011up or things of that nature, then so be it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They're going to do that anyways because they're great players. \r\nWe just try to play with our principles. \n\n",
  "Q. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0That driving dunk with a little bit less than four minutes to go in the fourth, can you describe what you saw as you were heading to the basket and took the pass from Mario. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't remember that play.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What happened?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm serious, which one? \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You gave Kevin his fifth foul on that one. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Oh, yeah, yeah, on the break.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just trying to attack.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We got a great block.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think we got a block, and Rio got the ball, and I started to call for it then and there, but I told him to go middle, so I just filled the lane and Rio hit me and I was able to finish.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I seen KD going for the charge, so I kind of went away from him a little bit and was able to get the block.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How would you describe the way you're playing in the fourth quarter right now the last couple games?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know, just trying to make plays.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I told you guys, last year I didn't make enough game\u2011changing plays, and that's what I kind of pride myself on.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I didn't do that last year in The Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm just trying to make game\u2011changing plays, and whatever it takes for our team to win, just trying to step up in key moments and be there for my teammates. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How did you feel when you guys were down by 10 in the third quarter?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And how would you characterize the comeback?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Was it just kind of a grind it out, not pretty but get the job done come back?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, how I was feeling down 10, we weren't playing our game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They made us stagnant and they came out in the third quarter and attacked us, and we didn't attack back.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We did that the last minutes of the third quarter and we was able to cut the lead, I think even taking the lead with D Wade's free throw. \r\nWe didn't play good to start the third, and we can't do that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We can't do that against an explosive team like that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But it just shows our character, how we was able to come back from that and make plays and regain the lead.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Was it kind of a grind\u2011it\u2011out mentality?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, that's our mindset, period.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's just how we play.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We always feel like we want to grind out games.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No matter how well we may be shooting the ball from the outside, no matter how many lay\u2011ups or dunks or fast\u2011break points we get, we always feel it's going to be a grind\u2011out game especially since we're playing against a great opponent.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So it was that. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Everyone knows that everyone on the Thunder is like 22, 23, except for Derek.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How do you guys guard against the next couple days thinking that you've broken a young team and this might get easier going forward?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's not.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We don't have that mindset.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Our mindset right now is coming into tomorrow we try to get better.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We have to get better in Game 4 because everyone makes an adjustments, everyone comes out the next game and does a better job. \r\nIn the fourth quarter we had an opportunity to extend the lead, and we turned the ball over.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We turned the ball over nine times in the fourth, I believe, and that's not winning basketball. \r\nWe know they're not broken.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For us, we just want to improve.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We want to improve each and every game, and we look forward to the challenge of Game 4. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Chris was in here earlier sort of talking about what you said about the series last year in Dallas, that this year you're not leaving anything on the table, you're putting it all together.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 At the end of the fourth quarter it was you, it was Chris, it was Dwyane getting it done.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How much is there resolve now that while you have nice supporting players, we have to step up, we have to step forward, us three, we have to get it done?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, we've got to make big plays.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, we understand our supporting cast is going to be there for us no matter what's going on throughout the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But if the game gets tight, one of the three of us, or all three of us, have to make plays to bring home the win. \r\nYou know, it was great to see us able to close this game out tonight.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had a comfortable lead, but they made a run.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They made a quick run, cut the lead to one, and then I was able to hit Chris for a lay\u2011up.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He got fouled, made two free throws, was able to get a stop, and that's what it's about.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's about us just trying to step up when our teammates need us the most.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You talk about wanting to attack.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It just seemed around the rim tonight that you were very physical from the very beginning, taking the ball from Perkins in a couple situations, going up with put\u2011backs.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Again, your mentality tonight played into that?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, we felt like they were going to come out aggressive, so I wanted to counter their aggression with aggression.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Put pressure on the rim offensively or get offensive rebounds, I was able to get five offensive rebounds to give us extra possessions and get some second\u2011chance points.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Looking at the stat sheet, we had 46 points in the paint, 11 second\u2011chance points.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So that's good.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And also we had 35 free throws.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's a really good number for us.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When we're getting to the free\u2011throw line, even when we don't shoot the ball well, that's a plus for us.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just always trying to be in aggressive mode and do whatever it takes to help our team come out with a win. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you explain how you guys continuously overcome a size disadvantage even as your team rotation kind of seems to get smaller.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And also, at this point are you just used to being a big basically for this team?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, size doesn't matter.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's about just will and determination.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It doesn't matter if someone is taller than you or bigger than you or weighs more than you.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You just try to put yourself in a position to get rebounds or make plays to help your team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's what it comes down to.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We don't care about teams being taller than us or I guess, quote\u2011unquote, bigger than us.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Every last one of our guys plays bigger than what their height is, bigger than what their weight is.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 As a team we don't feel like it's a disadvantage whoever we're going against. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How did Durant's foul trouble affect the dynamic of the second half? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is that a question for me or for them? \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For you. \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It doesn't change me.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How did his foul trouble affect the dynamic of the second half? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, if he's on the court or he's off the court, we have to still be aggressive.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We have to continue to do our play, play our game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think he got it going in the third.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He made some big shots in the third quarter, gave them the lead.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 His fourth foul on D Wade, we kind of got the momentum from there.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But he's a great player.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's going to make shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But for us, we have to be aggressive no matter if he's on the floor or not. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For the unprofessional eyes, it seems as if you can score whenever you want, just a matter of a decision of yours.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What do you think about it? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I wish it was that easy.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, that's a great team we're going against, and defensively they have some very active players, so they kind of bring the double\u2011team sometimes when I'm in the post or if I'm in the perimeter they kind of put two on the ball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just try to take what the defense gives me, try to get into the paint.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If I can't do it with the ball, just try to be active on the weak side or cutting or getting offensive rebounds or getting put\u2011backs that way, just try to do a little bit of everything where I'm not just isolating on the post or on the elbow. \r\nYou know, it's a good mixture of what I have right now, and my teammates do a good job of finding me when I don't have the ball. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Chris said you guys talked about the pain from last year all the time.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is that true?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And if so, how can you avoid it this time?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, it's absolutely true.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We talk about it all the time.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We understand that it's been a great teacher for us, just the experience.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We don't take things for granted.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We understand that we accept each challenge as its own, and we know Game 4 is going to be a different game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No matter what happened in Game 1, Game 2, Game 3, Game 4 is its own, and we will approach it like that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We understand that there's going to be a team that's going to come in and try to get the home\u2011court advantage back once again, try to win on our floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But if we do what we need to do defensively, we make them make tough shots, we rebound, and we don't turn the ball over, we give ourselves a good chance to win Game 4.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Looking forward to it. \n\n",
  "Q. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0You've got two guys on the team in Shane Battier and Mario Chalmers who have won college national titles and have a chance to add an NBA ring.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How cool would it be for those two guys to win a college and NBA ring?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And do you think it also helps, you've got UD and Dwyane who are champions in the NBA, but having two guys who have won championships in college on the team?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, it would be cool, honestly.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Everyone likes to build and put championships into their r\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a9sum\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a9.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It would be unique, and it would be cool at the same time for them. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You guys, especially in the two years you've been here, have really tried to build a home\u2011court advantage, make this a special place.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How has that come around?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you feel that the home\u2011court advantage you have here was similar to what you had in Cleveland?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And based on what the Thunder have at home, how important is it you feel something similar to what their crowd gave them in the first two games?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, you always want to try to be dominant at home and protect home.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 My days in Cleveland we was very dominant at home in the postseason and in the regular season.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You want to try to establish that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When people come into the building they feel like they're at a disadvantage already before the game starts.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And our fans here are great, have been great throughout the whole postseason in the last two years, and in Game 7 of the Boston series that just ended, it was the loudest they've been.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They was very excited about us winning that game and moving onto the Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So we look forward to seeing them tomorrow.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And they're going to bring that excitement that they've brought. \r\nOKC definitely has a unique fanbase and a great fanbase in OKC.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It has that college sound, that college feel, and I've never played in a hostile college environment, but I've been to a few games and I know the type of excitement that goes around it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They have something great that's there, and we do, as well. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There's been this theory about great scorers forever that, okay, you just concede a certain amount of points to them and worry about everybody else.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm sure that's probably been used against you a lot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is KD kind of at that point now where you just know he's going to get 30, and it's more about making sure that guys like Russ and everybody else just don't go off because you know Kevin is going to do what he does?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean, like you say, you can't stop KD, you just don't try to give him easy ones.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You don't want to give him an easy dunk in transition where you didn't get back on defense, or you give him a transition D because you didn't communicate and gave up and things like that of course, but he's going to make shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He can make any shot the game has to offer, off the dribble, off the catch\u2011and\u2011shoot, off pindowns, he can make every shot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You just try to wear on him, but he's going to make his shots and get his points because of the type of player he is. \r\nAnd then you've got to control everybody else.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Russell is going to get his points, as well, because he's that good of a player.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's that talented, as well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You just try to make them score, but not score because you had a breakdown or messed up on something.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If they score over the top or in front of you, then you can live with it.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There was a lot of buildup around this series, when are you able to enjoy it?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Are you able to enjoy it, or is it just too intense to enjoy with the competition? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, when I'm out on the floor I'm enjoying it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm having fun with these first two games.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, this is a great opportunity for myself and for our team, for both teams.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's a lot of fun being out there and competing at a high level, you know, the intense moment where every possession counts.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's what it's all about.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 As a competitor you have to enjoy these moments and you love these moments. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you watch video, are you able to enjoy it as a basketball fan, or not? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I think from a fan's perspective, I think it's been\u2011\u2011 the first two games have been great.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, I've seen some of the ratings, so that shows the excitement around the game of basketball, shows the excitement around the two teams, and what these two teams have to offer.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You have some great story lines and some individual plays.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think it's been great. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Why does it seem like we've only seen your team at its best when behind, like Game 4 against the Pacers, Game 6 begins the Celtics, Game 2 in this series? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I guess when we're behind and when we're down, that's the best time people like to see us at.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 People like to see us when we're behind and see how we're going to react or make adjustments going into the next game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, we've played good ball even when we were up, even in the New York series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We played good ball, we lost Game 4, but we was able to win Game 5. \r\nI don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We don't want to be behind (laughing), we're not trying to get down in the series, we can tell you that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But it's good to see that we can come back after a little adversity, a little down. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What is the difference in your game now when a year ago?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is it just a matter of being through this with this team one time and feeling more comfortable, or how much has that really helped you?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Me personally?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm just more comfortable.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, I spent seven years basically \u2011\u2011 the last five years in one system.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know the ins and outs about that whole system when I was in Cleveland, so I was very comfortable with that situation. \r\nA lot of things had to change in my one year here, and I never got fully adjusted throughout the whole year. \r\nThis year I've just been more comfortable with the team, more comfortable with the system, more comfortable with the city and everything around it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Once I get on the floor, I just let my game kind of react for me and everything I've built throughout the years, just go out and do it, and I don't have to worry about anything else. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Sort of along the same line, so much of I'm sure how you play is between your ears.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Are you more ready this year?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You seem more ready.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Are you more ready to meet the moment maybe this year?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Like I said, I'm going to go out and make plays for my team throughout the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm going to leave it out on the line, and at the end of the day, I'm going to be happy with that. \r\nWe want to win it, I want to win it, but I only can control what I can control, you know, and that's going out and being there for my teammates throughout the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's all I care about. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you talk about the evolution of Erik Spoelstra, how he has adapted over the last two years, and just his coaching style and the way he responds to you guys? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think Spo has been great.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, he's been challenged the last two years by a lot of people, but I think he's been awesome.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Two straight Finals appearances, and he's put us in position to win each and every game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, and for me, our relationship has grown over the last three years because we've been around each other, we understand what we like, our dislikes, everything of that nature, but he's been great.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's going to continue to grow, and I hope I can continue to grow around him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But he's been great.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's been a great coach. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just to follow up, do you have a specific example of either an interaction that was very meaningful or an example of when he might have listened to you that was effective?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, I just think he's been more open this year, you know, allowing some of the players to voice their opinion on certain situations, either at practice or in a game, no matter what the magnitude of the game is.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We trust him and he trusts us.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 At the end of the day, he has the last call because he is the head coach, but as a player you love that fact when a coach wants to hear or wants to feel what you may see out on the floor during the game or during the film session.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's been awesome. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Erik Spoelstra talked of motivating and motivation.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is there any speech he can give, any sentence he can utter, any bulletin board material that would motivate you any more than you're motivated right now? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah, absolutely.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He does a great job of doing that each and every day, keeping us motivated, keeping us ready for the taking, ready for the next game or just ready for the moment.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, every day, every game he comes in with something, and he gets us prepared, both by Xs and Os on the basketball court and also by other things to prepare us for the game. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 All five guys on the floor are important on defense, but for you guys how much is team defense a big part of the concept that you throw out there?\r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, team defense is everything.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We understand as an individual you want to take the individual challenge, but you also have to have that team defense and that team concept behind you or in front of you or on the side of you.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, because it helps you out individually when you know you have help, if you get beat, which everyone does in this game, or something happens where there's a breakdown, you know that someone behind you is going to protect you.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's always key. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What part of your game, if any, do you think needs improvement in this series? \r\nLeBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Everything.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Appreciate it. \n\n",
  "Q.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, could you just talk about, again, the start your team got off to, 18\u20112, and how important that was?\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It was very important.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Any time you get a lead in this series, it's important, no matter if it's a double digit lead or one\u2011point lead, because both teams are playing great basketball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Any time you can get a quick start and get a lead, it helps. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Can you talk about your teammate Shane Battier and the series that he's putting together?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's had two great games and just talk about what Battier is doing. \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's been a huge lift.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's been a huge lift for us.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's shooting the ball extremely well from the outside.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's making plays both offensively and defensively.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're going to need it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're going to need it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The series is going to be so tight that we're going to need guys to step up, and Shane has been there in the first two games. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 After winning Game 2, what do you guys feel is most important going into Game 3?\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've just got to continue to do what our staples are, try to get back in transition, level them off, make them take contested shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They're very good when you miss a shot or you turn the ball over at getting out and getting early buckets.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've got to continue to be conscious about our turnovers, and then when we miss a shot we've got to have three guys back just to try to level them off and not allow them to get those transition buckets. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, just the fact of can you address how important this game was, especially when it started slipping away, knowing you have a chance to go home 1\u20111, regain home court in the moment there, how much did that mean to a potential championship run to hold on somehow?\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It meant everything.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had played too well in the first 36 minutes to try to let this one slip away from us.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We knew we were going to keep coming.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We knew they were going to keep fighting.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They've been doing it the whole postseason against all the teams they've played against, especially on their home floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We just wanted to make one more or two more plays than they made and come out with a victory, and we was able to do that. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What did you want to do early on inside the paint? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For me it's all about aggression.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, I just try to get into the paint, make things happen, create for myself, create for others and put some pressure on their defense.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For me that's what my game is all built around. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Erik said that the decision for you to guard Durant with about seven minutes left was mutual.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How did that come about in the huddle, and can you go through what happened on the final play with you guarding Durant? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean, for me, I want to guard the best and the biggest point of the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 KD is an unbelievable talent.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think we all know that, we all see that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He can make every shot on the floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just try to keep a body on him, take contested shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He got away from me a couple times, got a couple threes that I am not too happy about.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So I'll watch the film and try to figure that out.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 On the last play they were down two and I figured they were going to go to him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He got a small step on me, I just wanted to try to keep a body on him, make him take a tough shot, and he's made tough shots all year, all series, and just that one he missed it. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You were on the other side of the two\u2011three\u2011two format last year.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What do you think of the format and do you think it gives an advantage to either side? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, when you get to the championship, teams got to win on each other's floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The two\u2011three\u2011two doesn't mean much, I guess.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know, you've got to\u2011\u2011 these are the two best teams.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They're confident no matter what building they're in.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're happy now that it's a 1\u20111 series and we're going back to Miami and will take control of the home court.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It doesn't mean that the series has changed.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Both teams can win on each other's floor, and both teams are confident. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Would you have been surprised to have heard a whistle on that last play?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Would you have been angry?\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, as a competitor, of course you would have been angry.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Like I said, I just tried to keep a body on him and make him take a tough one. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What has Shane Battier meant to you this season in terms of pregame preparation before every game and then guarding guys that you\u2011\u2011 relieving defensively, allowing you to get some rest?\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Shane has been huge.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Going against him in my career, I understood how smart he was, I understood how competitive he was, especially on the defensive end.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I was very excited when we was able to sign him in the off season.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's a big part of why we're here today and competing for a championship.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's meant a lot for our team, he's meant a lot to me, being able to guard guys as well as the top scorers.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He did it against Carmelo Anthony, from Carmelo Anthony to David West to Paul Pierce and Brandon Bass all the way down to Ibaka and Kevin Durant.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He can guard multiple positions and allows our team to have so many options defensively.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He plays a big part in that. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When so much is made of you and your team's fourth quarter meltdowns and you hit 12 of 12 free throws, including four in the fourth quarter, is that a milestone, or is that just a game in which you've got a little confidence?\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, I'm a confident guy.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 On a big stage like this in a big game like this, every point counts, every point matters.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So you go to the free\u2011throw line, no matter how hostile the environment, and try to knock them down.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You live with your routine, things you practice all year, and you live with the results.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Like I said, I'm happy that I was able to go up there and make a few plays, go up there and make my free throws.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We needed it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We needed every point tonight.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But that's not like a larger statement about you guys in the fourth quarter, that's just one game?\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's just\u2011\u2011 we want to make enough plays to win basketball games, not to answer any questions about what people have to say about us. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Talk about the pressure after losing Game 1.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How did you feed off of that and utilize that as a motivating catalyst to come back and get this big win?\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, it's a huge game for us.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We understood that we wanted to split.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had an opportunity in Game 1, but it kind of slipped away from us in the fourth quarter, they took control of the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And Game 2, we wanted to come out and get the win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We didn't want to go home being down 0\u20112 even having three games on our home floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It was good to see the sense of urgency to start the game, and then late in the game make enough plays to even the series. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 As you were going to the basket and being so aggressive early, are you in that mindset thinking that there's nobody on this floor that can guard me?\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, for me I always want to be aggressive, and I don't think there was just one guy that can guard me.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, I'm always looking at the next line of defense and seeing the rotation coming.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes it doesn't work in my favor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I got into the hole one time, Ibaka got me from behind, got a block.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I don't think it's just one guy.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You can't just put one guy on me and allow him to be on an island and defend me one\u2011on\u2011one.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's about being aggressive and taking what the defense gives me.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When I shoot double digit free throws, that means I know personally I'm being aggressive when I'm getting to the rim.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 At the end of the day, it's helping our team. \n\n",
  "Q.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you guys played the Pacers and the Celtics, those teams every game, same starting lineup, same approach.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You guys have changed lineups because of Chris's injury but also changed approaches a lot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How difficult has it been going through these rounds with different defensive assignments, different philosophies, different approaches and different lineups?\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's not been too difficult.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's just been challenging.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you go out there with different lineups from game to game, it's challenging for sure.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But we've been able to figure it out.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We've been able to figure it out on the fly and find ways to make it successful either for that game or that series in general. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I talked to some Thunder players and they said one of the most intriguing aspects about this series is so many players are diversified defensively and we saw some of that last night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you envision a lot of weird match\u2011ups throughout the whole series? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah, I think so.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just because of the depth of teams and both teams have so many guys that can do so many things defensively, that can guard multiple positions defensively.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, it allows both coaches to be flexible.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You can see that throughout the course of the series. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We were talking with Russell Westbrook earlier and he said he started the trend with the glasses; is that right? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, that's not right. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I didn't think so.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What's the story behind that? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There's no stories behind it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, it's a look, it's a fashion thing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But he absolutely didn't start it.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Who started it? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know who started it, honestly.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think know I've wearing mine for about two years now.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I don't know who started it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 None of us started it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It could have started back in the '70s or '80s.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm serious.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, fashion comes and goes, decades\u2011\u2011\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 All four of you guys had on the glasses last night.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Was there something behind that?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Did you guys get together and say we're all going to wear lensless glasses?\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, we didn't.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It just happened like that. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Dwyane said earlier this year that there was a point where he sat down with you and told you he wanted you to be you, be a leader and take over.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you ever find yourself having to flip it with him and trying to tell him that you need him to be Dwyane and be the guy that\u2011\u2011\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Absolutely, I tell him a lot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 A lot of times I try to let him figure it out on his own, but sometimes I go to him and tell him I need one of those games from him, I need one of those performances from him because he still has it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He knows he still has it, too, but every player needs a little kick every now and then, no matter how time tested they are.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Yeah, I try to continue to let him know how important he is to this team, which he should know, but he also needs to be D Wade and not worry about deferring as much. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Does it surprise you the second year in that you guys still find those moments where you're trying to figure out when to defer and when to take over?\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm not surprised because it's nowhere near close to last year.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 This year it's happened maybe a handful of times, I can probably count on my hands as many times it happened as much basketball as we play.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Last year it happened a lot.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It happened every week or every other week where we was trying to figure out ways we can help our team or we can figure out ways we can help one another.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But it wasn't happened much this year, so it's not surprising when it comes up.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's just reassurance. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 From an outsider, it doesn't appear that you play with the joy or the theatrics that you once did.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If that's true, is that just a sign of getting older or is it a change of venue?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What do you think is the answer to that? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think I have a lot of fun with the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, I'm back to having\u2011\u2011 this year in particular, I have a lot of fun or I've had a lot of fun with the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I got back to what drove me to the game and what made me fall in love with the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's been a great ride this whole year, and just doing the things that need to be done to help our ballclub win and for me to have fun on and off the floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I feel good. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you heard that Shane was starting on Durant, what was your reaction, and then are you going to\u2011\u2011 do you expect that to change?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you want that to change and have you cover him tomorrow? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, it's whatever, honestly.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, I will do whatever it takes for our team to win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 If I need to start on him, I will.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I kind of\u2011\u2011 coach gave us an idea for Game 1, and we went with it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We still had an opportunity to win Game 1, we just didn't make enough plays. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You mentioned talking to Dwyane every once in a while.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What have you or what will you say to him in a larger sense before Game 2? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Oh, I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Like I said, I don't say something to him before every game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know even if I will for Game 2.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We'll see.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't have nothing planned as of right now what I may say to him to prepare him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, he's a winner, he's a veteran, he knows how to prepare, so forth, for a Finals game, this being his third.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We'll see. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 On a separate note, when you feel at ease with your surroundings or where you are, where you're living, anything like that, how does that affect your play on the court? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, when you're at ease, honestly, the game becomes very easy for you.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For me it's just once I was comfortable with everything that was going on off the court, I was able just to let my preparation and all the years that I've put into playing the game of basketball just take care of itself.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know how much work I've put into the game, and I don't dis\u2011appreciate the game in no way, I don't take it for granted me being in the position I'm in.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I kind of let it take care of itself, and it rewards me. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We saw in the last series with KG that there were very specific times where he would come out of games.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Even if it wasn't good for Boston at that point, it was good for them when he did go back in.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You're a different player, different point in your career, but knowing yourself, what is the rhythm that works best for you in terms of some rest during the course of a game no matter how important, and is there something about even seeking rest that you want to avoid right now?\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, it's a fine line, honestly, especially now being in The Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There's always times where you would like to get a minute here, a minute there, two minutes there, and I've got to be more out with my coaching staff, as well, when I feel like I may need a minute here or a minute there and then I can go back into the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But there's also times where I may feel tired, but I'm playing well, we're playing well, so I don't want to mess up the rhythm, and this is a rhythm game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's a fine line with getting rest and just playing through it because I don't feel like I hurt my teammates when I am out there.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But it's just all about a communication thing, getting two\u2011minutes rest here, three\u2011minutes there.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It may can help.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What is the difference at this point in the year in terms of the timeouts, the longer breaks?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Does that make up for the time where you're actually sitting out game time? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean, any time the timeouts or the TV timeouts, the breaks, halftime, you get rest, you're able to recoup and reenergize.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, it helps. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know there were tactical reasons for you not to start possessions on Kevin because you can switch onto him when they screen, but you also mentioned recently not having any regrets in the last series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You don't want to have any regrets.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Could you go through this series with no regrets if the buck doesn't stop with you defensively on KD? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, this is one game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We will make adjustments.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 This is going to be a long series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm not worried about the end of the series right now. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've talked about during the Indiana series getting Dwyane some maybe easy looks earlier in the game, kind of got him going, got him into a flow, more so than maybe saying something off the court, is that what's necessary sometimes to help him break through?\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It is.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It is necessary for any scorer.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, you look at last night, I mean, Kevin Durant had 10 points in transition, Russell Westbrook had 10 points in transition.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Scorers, when you get those easy transition buckets, the jump shot starts to feel more better, the pull\u2011up jumpers that are contested feel more better, and for D Wade and for myself, we feel the same way.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When you guys see us get out on the break and we got alley\u2011oop dunks and lay\u2011ups and things like that, we start to make a lot of plays.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I always try to make a conscious effort especially with D\u2011Wade to try to get him some easy ones, you know, get him a dunk in transition or get him a lay\u2011up or in half court where he's not facing the double\u2011team, what he's going to be facing for most of the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So it helps. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Touching on that, are you a better half\u2011court team when you and him are playing that two\u2011man game and you're getting him going? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, I mean, every game is its own.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes we're good, we're great when we're playing our two\u2011man game, and other times it has our offense stagnant and it's not allowing us to get the ball from one side to the other.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think we're very good offensively and in the half court when we're attacking, no matter what we're doing, either we're playing two\u2011man game or we're moving the ball from one side to the other and we're attacking the rim and getting to the free\u2011throw line.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So that's when we're at our best. \n\n",
  "Q.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Dwyane, when did it get away from you guys?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You led most of the game to the tail end of the third quarter.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When and why did it get away from you? \r\nDWYANE WADE:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I thought coming out of the third quarter they did a great job of turning up defensive pressure to get right back in it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 From that point it was pretty much a one\u2011possession kind of game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, they just made more plays than us.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They got a couple offensive rebounds that kind of hurt us.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They got a couple open shots, and then from that point, we was kind of playing behind. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you came out defensively against Perkins instead of against KD.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Was that your choice and would you have liked to spend more time on him at the outset, and do you think that might change next game? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 No, it wasn't my choice, it was a suggestion that Spoel brought up, and I thought it was good early on for us.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It gave us an opportunity to switch a lot of pick and rolls when Perk went down and did a screen for KD and I was able to switch off for him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Whatever the case may be, we had a good game plan to start the game, and the third quarter hurt us. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 LeBron, you only played six guys really, a good amount of the time.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You played a few more, but it was a short bench.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Did that play a part in the game late in terms of getting tired? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't think so.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, we know we have to have more production for sure.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're going to have to have more guys in there to give me and D Wade a rest.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And Shane, Shane played a lot of minutes.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But Spoel will figure that out.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We'll be more conscious about it, just trying to get a minute or two here or there so we can finish strong, but I don't think it was much of a problem tonight. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What was going on with you guys able to free up Shane Battier with so many open looks? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think offensively we just moved the ball.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We moved the ball, and Shane was the recipient of those\u2011\u2011 of us moving the ball, especially in the first half.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He knocked down a lot of shots, you know, and he helped us a lot to spread the floor.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's a big part of our unit, and when he knocks down shots, we're a very, very good team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He was just the recipient of us moving the ball and getting the ball from one side to another, and he was able to get some shots down.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Erik said that you guys felt even to the middle of the fourth quarter you were in position to make a move, and then they just, quote, went away.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What do you think happened there? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think they made shots and we missed shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The couple offensive rebounds they got, they didn't make many mistakes in the fourth quarter.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't think we made many mistakes in the fourth quarter, it's just they made more plays, especially offensively.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They made more shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Russell made some big\u2011time shots, KD made some big\u2011time shots, and Nick Collison got a few offensive rebounds that allowed him to extra possessions when we did a stop.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So I think that's what it's about.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So how do you guys get those shots, make those shots, and be in those position yourself? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You take them with confidence, take more shots with confidence, and at the end of the day you live with it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 All your shots are not going to go in, of course not, but you try to put pressure on the defense, and then when you shoot the ball, you shoot it with confidence. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 As soon as Spoelstra came in here, he talked about adjustments that you guys were going to make in Game 2.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Dwyane, getting you going, you talked about lengthening the bench and getting Bosh more minutes.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What do you see as the major adjustments in such a short amount of time? \r\nDWYANE WADE:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I can't say right now, man, fresh out of the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's one thing that we're confidence in is that our coaching staff is going to get us a game plan, the rotation that we need.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 This first game, as in every series, is always just a game to see.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We're on the road, we come here, we try to win one.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Now we make the adjustments, we come out and we try to split the next game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm not worried about it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm sure we'll find some better opportunities for ourselves, and we'll be more comfortable in Game 2. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Dwyane, there are games where you're just attacking and look like you're having a lot of fun and then there's games like this where you're not.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's about 50/50 throughout the Playoffs.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What is that with you? \r\nDWYANE WADE:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It all depends what you mean.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I was attacking, getting my teammates shots, and I got shots for myself.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Attacking to me is just being aggressive.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Some nights I have big nights scoring and some nights I don't.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's been the season.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 That's just the way that it's designed for me. \r\nI'm just always staying aggressive, like I said, for myself and for my teammates to make sure they get good looks, and also be aggressive for myself to get shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Some are going to go in, some are not. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You guys gave up 56 points in the paint.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How do you plan on stopping that next game? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Not give up 56 points in the paint.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 (Laughter). \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Talk about going forward after this loss, you've definitely got to make adjustments on defending KD and Russell.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Talk about the efforts that's going to take to stop those guys.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You did do a good job on Harden because he only had five points. \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, first of all, those two guys are all stars for a reason.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You can't stop them, you just try to limit them.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And Russ made some big plays late, but I think we can live with him shooting 10 for 24 from the field. \r\nI think KD got a couple looks that we don't like.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He had two transition threes that we gave up where he had nobody on him, and he had a couple jumpers that we didn't like, either, with nobody on him.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We need to make adjustments with that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We will make adjustments.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Like D Wade said, this was the feel out game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We come out with a lot of energy, try to steal Game 1, and now we get an opportunity to go to the chalkboard, go to the film and have a better game plan in Game 2 since we've already seen them to see to see what they're capable of doing. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Kevin had the big fourth quarter.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Could you sense he was being aggressive and looking for his shot more? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 He's always aggressive.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Any time he's on the floor, tonight 46 minutes, he's always aggressive.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It doesn't matter what court it is. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 After the first quarter and a half or so, why did the ball stop moving as well as it had been? \r\nDWYANE WADE:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think we had that answer when it kept moving.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Sometimes the game goes to where guys attack a little more, especially when the ball is me and LeBron handle a lot, we attack a lot and it's not as much swing\u2011swing, and that's good for our team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But we'll look at it and we'll see why and we'll see if we can get better opportunities.\r\nBut I thought we got good shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I thought we got good shots for our teammates, I thought we got good shots for ourselves.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Obviously we just need to make more.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I wasn't disappointed in the shots we got tonight. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Dwyane, this morning you talked about picking and choosing your shots.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How different has that been for you?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Has it been a difficult process? \r\nDWYANE WADE:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Sorry, man.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, it's The Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I've been doing it all year.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I am going to continue to do it.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm a winner, so I'm just doing whatever I can help to help my team win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Some nights \u2011\u2011 one night I'm going to have a big night scoring, some nights I'm going to have a big nights doing other things.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just doing whatever it takes to win the ballgame, not necessarily sitting up here worrying about scoring 30 points.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I know that's going to make you guys feel better.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm all about winning.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We didn't win tonight, and that's the biggest thing, so we'll find a way to win Game 2, not necessarily worried about me scoring 30. \n\n",
  "Q.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Your two Finals experiences you've had so far haven't exactly been the best experiences, I would imagine.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How is that shaping the way you're coming into this thing? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I just feel more at ease now.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 My third appearance. \r\nLast year, so much had gone on with that series and the whole season.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And like I said, I played too much to prove people wrong last year, instead of just playing my game and doing what needs to be done. \r\nAnd then the first, I was young, inexperienced.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We had an inexperienced team, and the San Antonio team did what they wanted to against us in that first experience. \r\nFor me, I'm just at ease now.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 At the end of the day in this series, I'm going to play my game, try to do whatever it takes on both ends to make plays and help us win.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 And at the end of the day, whatever the results happen, I'm going to be satisfied with that.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I'm going to be happy with it because I know I'm going to give it my all, and I won't leave nothing behind. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's already been said, people are going to keep saying it, the winner of this series gets to be called the best player in the game, whether it's you or Kevin.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is that a fair statement, or do you consider yourself maybe you're already the guy? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't really care.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't really get involved in the best player in the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It doesn't matter to me, really.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When I go out on the basketball court each and every night, I want to be the best player in the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I want to be the best player on that floor, and that's just how I approach the game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So I don't really care what people say at the end of this series if KD or LeBron is the best player in the league.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It has to happen at some point anyways.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I won't be the best player in the league, KD will be, and then KD won't be the best player in the league at some point.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It happens all the time.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It doesn't really matter, so I don't care.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 When we talked about taking that different approach, not trying to prove anyone wrong, trying to play your game, what was your intention going into it?\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But when it turned out to actually do it, has it been harder than you thought, easier than you thought?\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 A little bit of both.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 There's been sacrifices that have been made throughout this whole season.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I had to get out of a lot of my comfort zone, a lot of things that I was comfortable with I had to\u2011\u2011 I had to change some things both on and off the floor, but it's always great when you put your mind to something, you strive to do something, and then it rewards you.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's been rewarding to this point, but like I said, I'm happy that I'm able to be back in the position I was a few years ago when I was just playing the game at a high level, having fun, and then whatever the chips laid, I was satisfied with it because I know I gave it my all. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Dwyane was saying they're going to need you to play at that level that you've been performing at some of these games you've been producing.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 How draining was Game 6 and 7 for you, and where is your energy level at now? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Game 6, I felt great.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I felt great.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Mentally it was draining.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Physically it was draining, as well, but I felt great throughout that whole game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's draining when you finally get into the locker room and you just\u2011\u2011 you guys always see me got my feet in the ice tub and my knees are wrapped. \r\nThen after Game 7, it was even more draining, just the emotions around that series, knowing the team we beat, I mean, it's probably one of the best coached teams that you can ever compete against.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Doc Rivers keeps those guys prepared, and they have four future Hall of Famers in Paul, Rondo, KG and Ray.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's challenging going against those guys.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So it was very draining not only Game 6 and Game 7, but series in general.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You mentioned earlier your first trip to The Finals in 2007, you went against a very experienced team in San Antonio.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What's your view on how much experience matters in the NBA Finals having been there before? \r\nLEBRON JAMES: \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I mean, it all depends.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But if you've got a great team and you're coached well, you know you can always succeed, as well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I just think for me, in '07, I don't think as a team we had a good enough team to get there, but I don't think\u2011\u2011 I said it in the press conference after we lost The Finals that we'd got beaten by a better team.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 They were better than us and they showed us.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We beat us four straight games, and they showed us why they were champions even before that Finals. \r\nBut I don't know how much experience plays into a Finals.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We were two experienced teams last year, and Dallas was victorious.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We'll see.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We'll see what happens. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 From the moment you guys came together, you guys were kind of overwhelming favorites and had the target on you from day one.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You come into this series where the Thunder is favored.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Is that a little weird and is that maybe a little welcome?\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's not weird, it's not welcoming.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's a seven\u2011game series.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 The two best teams in the league right now.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It doesn't matter who's favored and who's not favored.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just got to go out there and play.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 It's a 48\u2011minute game, and whatever team plays harder or is more composed and makes the right plays at the right time in that particular game is going to win.\n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Do you walk into this Game 1 with a different sense, a different feeling than you did a year ago in any way? \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I have a different feeling as far as comfort, but I still went into Game 1 last year with a lot of\u2011\u2011 I mean, I was focused, and we wanted to win that game, and we did win that game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 We played well that game.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But I don't know, we was at home, this one is on the road, so it's going to be more challenging for us.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 But we look forward to the challenge. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Beyond the summer workouts and the game at Morgan State with Kevin, where did your relationship begin with him, how did it develop, and where is it right now?\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, our relationship has been growing since he was in high school, all the way through Texas and all his years in the NBA.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 For me, I understood what the situation he was getting himself into being drafted as high as he was, and the things that came with being drafted to a team that needed a marquee player or a superstar.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You know, from day one I always lent my hand out to guide him if he needed it, to help him, to mentor him if he needed it through anything, and that's on and off the floor, because to that point I seen everything, and I'm still learning but I've seen everything on and off the floor.\r\nOur relationship is really good.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Our relationship is going to continue to grow, and I'm happy to be in this position where I can compete against him. \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've had a lot of introspection this year.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 You've talked about it, changing things.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I guess looking back to last season in The Finals, I mean, what exactly happened and how can you avoid similar\u2011\u2011\r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 What do you mean what exactly happened? \n\nQ.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Well, obviously the last series you were averaging 33 points a game against Dallas. \r\nLEBRON JAMES:\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I didn't play well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I think I said that 100 times this year.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I didn't play well.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I didn't make enough game\u2011changing plays that I know I'm capable of making, and I felt like I let my teammates down.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 I don't know if that's something I haven't said before.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 Just didn't make enough plays. \r\nI'm happy, and I'm humbled that I can actually be back in this position less than 12 months later to do a better job of making more plays, more game\u2011changing plays out on the floor on a bigger stage.\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 So we'll see what happens. \n\n",
  "Q. LeBron, given your performances late in games in these Finals, what's your assessment of your ability to play well under pressure? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I mean, sometimes you got it, sometimes you don't. And that was this case in this series. I was able to do things in the last two series to help us win ballgames. Wasn't able to do that in this series. Once you get to the playoffs, every game is pressure. You want to win. You have to win. And I mean, we've seen some of that in the Chicago series, we seen some of that in the Boston series. Even though we lost Game 4, we lost Game 4 in Philly, there's pressure in that series as well. \r\n So it doesn't matter which round it is. Once you get to the postseason, every possession counts. \n\n Q. LeBron, what in this Finals round were you personally unable to do that you wanted to do? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Live in the paint. They did a great job of every time I drove, they brought another extra defender in front of me. They did a great job defensively. Very underrated defensive team. Took me out of a lot of things that I'm capable of doing or used to doing. It took us out of a lot of things we're capable of doing, that's getting points to the paint and getting to the free-throw line. So they did a good job. Much respect to them. \n\n Q. Considering all that you went through this past summer and all the effort you made to get here to specifically win a championship, what are your emotions losing The Finals now? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: It hurts of course. I'm not going to hang my head low. I know how much work as a team we put into it. I know how much work individually that I've put into it, when you guys are not around. That's something people don't see. I think you can never hang your head low when you know how much work, how much dedication you put into the game of basketball when the lights are off and the cameras are not on. \n\n Q. LeBron, obviously you've dealt with so much criticism for the last year that wasn't at all to do with basketball. When you're getting criticized for what's happening on the court, does that bother you? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: No, that doesn't bother me. I understand this is a huge stage, and you want to perform well for nobody else besides your teammates. That's ultimately what it's about for me. If I can play well for my teammates, help my teammates win basketball games, then I'm always satisfied with that. It hurts me, and I get on myself when I'm not able to play well and help my teammates win. \n\n Q. Does it bother you that so many people are happy to see you fail? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Absolutely not. Because at the end of the day, all the people that was rooting on me to fail, at the end of the day they have to wake up tomorrow and have the same life that they had before they woke up today. They have the same personal problems they had today. I'm going to continue to live the way I want to live and continue to do the things that I want to do with me and my family and be happy with that. \r\n They can get a few days or a few months or whatever the case may be on being happy about not only myself, but the Miami Heat not accomplishing their goal, but they have to get back to the real world at some point. \n\n Q. One for LeBron and Dwyane Wade, same thing: You guys were favored to win this series, you're expected to win tonight. I'm sure you guys expected to win. It's an overused word, and I don't mean this in any disrespect, I want to know your feelings, do you feel you choked in this series? \r\n DWYANE WADE: First of all, we give credit to the Dallas Mavericks. They're a hell of a team. \r\n The word \"choked\" is overused in sports, period. We lost ballgames. We lost The Finals. We ran into a team that at this time obviously was better than us. So we give them credit, and we take nothing away from that. \n\n Q. LeBron, with all the pressure, the criticism, the expectations, did it ever get to a point where it just weighed heavy and affected you in any way? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I don't think so. I pretty much don't listen to what everybody has to say about me or my game or what I've done with my career. I don't get involved in that. This is year after year after year for me. Me as an individual, people write or say what they want to say about me. It doesn't weigh on me at all. \r\n Like I said, the only thing that weighs on me is when I don't perform well for my teammates and the guys that I play for every day. That's the only thing that weighs on me. Because I take pride in going out there and doing the things that need to be done to help my teammates win. That's it. \n\n Q. What was going through your mind entering the fourth quarter knowing you guys had that hole to get out of? What was your mentality? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Honestly, it was about fourth-quarter defense and trying to get buckets. We got into a good groove to start the fourth. I think J.J. Barea's three at the end of the shot clock was a huge shot. Put them up seven. That was a huge shot. I think it was 81-77 at that time. He hit a shot, the three at the end of the shot clock. We played defense 23 straight -- great defense for 23 straight seconds and he hit a shot like that. So it took a little bit out of us. You don't want to dig a hole like that against anyone. Especially on your home floor going into the fourth. \n\n Q. Dwyane, Spo was in here and he said that under no circumstances did he envision it ending tonight. That he thought Game 7 was coming. That you guys would be at your best. Is it shock right now? Is it anger? Is there any emotion coursing through you right now or is it too early for anything to set in at this point? \r\n DWYANE WADE: No matter what, you are never ready for your season to end. Whether it ends during the regular season, in the first round, you always are shocked, especially in the playoffs, when your season comes to an end. You can never predict it. At this point, obviously if you don't win a championship, no matter if it's Game 6 or Game 7, you're going to be highly disappointed. So, you know, obviously in the midst of losing, we feel it, but we'll feel it more tomorrow. And the more time we get to think about it and think about how close an opportunity we had, it will burn inside of us as competitors. At the end of the day, it will drive us to get back in this position again. \r\n So we understand that our goal is to win a championship. We wasn't able to accomplish that year one. But this ain't the end of the Miami Heat. We'll use this as motivation and come back and try to do it again. \n\n Q. Through four games, even though it's 2-2, you can make a strong argument you guys were the better team. I don't think anyone would have been surprised if those other two games turned out victories for you guys. Where or how did the series get away from you? \r\n DWYANE WADE: It got away from us tonight when they won. This series was a close series the whole way. They were able to put a great run together tonight. We can never get over the hump. Every time we closed within four or three, they just continued to make shots. So this series was -- could have went either way for a long time, until they pulled away tonight. \r\n Like I said, we give them much credit. Their resolve was stronger than ours in this series. So we'll learn from that, and we'll come back as a better team and try to use some of the experience that we learned in this championship round. \n\n Q. Dwyane, you said a few months after you won your championship that Dirk was the reason the Mavericks lost that series because he wasn't the leader he was supposed to be in the closing moments. What do you think of the way he performed in those moments during this series? \r\n DWYANE WADE: I think he's played awesome, man. Obviously Dirk, five years ago, it burned in him. He learned from that experience. Even though he was 1-for-12 in the first half, he came out and made big shots for his team. He kept being aggressive, he kept shooting. \r\n So there's no question he's been a great individual player, and now that he's a champion, it goes without saying, what does it mean for his career. So congratulations to him. \n\n Q. LeBron, we know it's a team game and a team loss, but we know the player you are. We've seen the things you've done. We know the aspirations you have. Do you take this as a personal failing? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Any time you feel like you get to the top of the mountain and you fall off, there's definitely a personal failure. It was a failure in '07 when we lost to the Spurs when I was in Cleveland, it's a failure now for myself losing to the Mavericks. Absolutely. \n\n Q. For both of you guys, Rick Carlisle was in here and he spoke of his team feeling that there were billions of people that wanted the Mavericks to win. I know you guys have talked all year about not feeling that America is on your side, but do you think that might change eventually? Would you like it to change? And do you think that going through a loss where it hasn't been easy for the Heat might get people to come around? \r\n DWYANE WADE: Well, me personally, honestly, we can't worry about that. Everyone has an opinion. Everyone has options in life, and whether they want to be a Miami Heat fan or not, we cannot worry about that. The only thing we can do is go out for our supporters and our fans and our family and play the game the right way and enjoy it while we have it. \r\n So obviously a lot of people wanted Dallas to win more so than us for many reasons. But that wasn't the reason that we lost, and that wasn't the reason they won. It had nothing to do about the game of basketball when it started. But, obviously, going forward, we're going to come back in and no matter if we're loved or not, we're going to come back in and we're going to work hard every day, like we do, and we're going to approach the game the way we always do. \n\n Q. What do you guys think of the perception out there that this represents a victory for a team over a group of individuals? \r\n DWYANE WADE: Well, I mean, I personally think we all are individuals that become a team. Same thing with Dallas. They had to put pieces together to get a championship. They did a great job of that. I think signing Tyson Chandler this summer was probably the thing that helped them get to this point. We did a good job of bringing individuals together to become a team. That's the way it happens. No matter what caliber of a player it is, everyone fits. It's like a puzzle. And their pieces came together a little bit better than ours at the end. \n\n Q. It's a different philosophy in terms of having a top-heavy payroll versus something more balanced. \r\n DWYANE WADE: They have a top-heavy payroll. We have a top three-heavy payroll. A lot of guys who took minimums to be here. I believe they have a top payroll as well. I'm pretty sure. Obviously everyone looks at us three signing together and thinking we have the highest payroll in the NBA. We don't at all. They put a championship team together. No matter which way you do it, signing Dirk was big obviously this summer. Adding Tyson Chandler and adding Shawn Marion a year ago was big. So they've been building it. Eventually we're going to build it. It just didn't happen this year. \n\n Q. LeBron, I know this may be tough to think about, but right now what do you feel like it's going to take for you to win a championship? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I can only prepare myself each year. In the summertime I'll put a lot of hard work into my individual game, try to bring my individual game to a team, and I work hard every day as an individual to go out there and perform at a high level for my teammates and for myself. I got close. Won two more games than I did in '07, and hopefully next time I get here I'll win two more games than I did in '11. \n\n Q. LeBron, you were a closer in the Chicago series, probably the best player in the NBA. No offense, Dwyane. Everyone is going to figure out or try to figure out what happened in these fourth quarters in terms of not closing like you did in the East Finals. What was the reason for that? And in terms of lacking your usual aggression, the way it appeared, everything okay off the court in terms of distractions or anything like that? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I've been in this league eight years. There's no distractions that can stop me from trying to chase an NBA championship. Not you guys, not anything that goes on that's not focused on my team and my teammates and what we're out there -- what we're out set to do. Like I said before, I work hard to try to put myself in position to play at a high level. When you go out on the court, does the ball always go in? Absolutely not. But the one thing I know, I never hold my head low in saying, I didn't do it the right way or I wish I would have did this. It's not about that. \r\n I put a lot of hard work into this season individually. We all did. So we have nothing to hang our heads low. Just use this as an extra motivation to help myself become a better player for next year. \r\n DWYANE WADE: Thank you. \r\n THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys. \n\n ",
  "Q. LeBron, what's the last 48 hours sort of been like for you, 36, whatever it's been? And just where is the confidence level now as -- Spo talked about how none of you would have declined the offer to play two games at home for a world title. Is that how you look at it? Or do you go even more deeper than that? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: The last 48 hours have been thinking about Game 5. Some of the opportunities we had to win. Some of the opportunities I had to make plays, and either made them or didn't. At one point we look at it we're up three with three and a half minutes to go. We had an opportunity. We played well enough to win that game, even though with them making 13 threes, unbelievable shooting for them. We still had an opportunity to win. \r\n I thought about that and also kind of shifted my focus to how can I be better and how can our team be better in Game 6. We worked all year to get home court, and even though we're in an elimination game, we feel like we still have a great opportunity with this series coming back to Miami, two games on our home floor. \n\n Q. LeBron, you're averaging something like 44 minutes a game in this series. Is that too much? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I don't think it's too much. I feel like I'm in world-class condition. Like I said, anytime you get a little rest here, a little rest there, it definitely helps. I wouldn't say it's too much. I don't think so. I don't feel like I'm hurting my team for the time I'm out there. I don't feel like it's too much. \n\n Q. LeBron, you said that you've played well enough to win in these games. How frustrating is it knowing that the tough shots that they're hitting late, they go 13-for-19 from the three-point line, and you can't change any of that. You're still down 3-2. Do you feel you guys are still right where you need to be? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: It's frustrating, of course. When you look at the three games we lost, we all had the opportunity to win. Game 2 being up 15. In Game 4, we had an opportunity. And in Game 5 we had an opportunity. \r\n It is frustrating when you look back at the film and you watch and you see some of the mistakes that you had, not only individually but as a team. But it's something you can't -- you have to try to move on. But also learn from those games where you had an opportunity to win and seeing the games where you won, where you took advantage of them. \r\n So I think it's a new game, Game 6 being tomorrow night, and we're looking forward to it coming back to our home floor. \n\n Q. LeBron, you talked about the last 48 hours, have you looked at your shot in terms of technique or anything? Have you been analyzing why the shot just doesn't look the same of late? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: At this point I don't think technique has anything to do with it. Shots go in, shots don't go in. I don't stop to think about my technique or anything like that. One thing about me, you just be aggressive. And when you have the shot, you take them. Some of the same shots I've taken in the other series, they went in. They're not going in for me right now, that won't deter me from taking that opportunity once I get them again. \n\n Q. There's urgency and there's pressure. How do you sort out the differences between that? And how do you tell how your teammates are handling those few things? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I think the game of basketball can be pressure. It doesn't matter if it's The Finals or the Conference Finals or first round. Playoff basketball is all about pressure, how you can handle it. There's a sense of urgency because we're on an elimination game coming into Game 6. But it's something if I sit here and say we haven't seen everything to help us out to get to this position this year, I would be lying to myself and lying to our team. \r\n This is a position -- I mean, we wouldn't want to be in this position being down 3-2. But at the same time we're going to relish the opportunity being back on our floor. \n\n Q. LeBron, can you talk about J.J. Barea, what you guys have to do to contain him a little better? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I mean, honestly, J.J., he shot the ball extremely well. The guy hit four threes, three of them was at the end of the shot clock with him not even holding his follow-through. A guy like that once he gets into the lane and he gets a few lay-ups, get into the flow, his outside shot becomes better, just like a lot of us. Myself and D-Wade, if you allow us to get two or three lay-ups, we feel like we're in a good rhythm. So we have to do a better job of trying to keep him out the paint. If you keep him out of the paint early, that's better for us. He doesn't shoot the ball as well as he would if he gets a few lay-ups here, a few lay-ups there, a couple of free-throws. \r\n He's a key. We always say he's a key. J.J. being a key and J.T. being a key to their success. \n\n Q. When you've looked at the fourth quarters, have you seen yourself being less aggressive? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I've seen myself being less aggressive at times. A few reasons is most of the time I feel like D-Wade has it going. In situations where in the past in the last series there was times I had it going, in the Chicago series or in the Boston series, and our team just rolled me offensively. Guys just try to pick it up, some way, somehow. \r\n D-Wade has been playing extremely well in the fourth quarter. CB has played well. And just haven't found my niche in the fourth quarter thus far. You look at it, tomorrow is another opportunity for me to make an imprint on this series in the fourth quarter and help our team win. \n\n Q. LeBron, it's likely no athlete has been scrutinized the way you have prior to this. And I know you went through it a lot last summer and through the season, but this is The Finals. It's a bigger stage. What have you learned through the first week, week and a half of this that you can apply to the next few days about how to handle this and the attention that's on you? Because that's something Erik was just talking about, how your mentality of processing all that. \r\n LeBRON JAMES: It's nothing that I've seen over The Finals that I didn't know coming into this series. I understood this is a huge series. It's a huge stage. I want to play well, of course. I want to help this team win a championship. That's all it's about. The things that you can't control, the ball going in for you, or you playing extremely well every single game. The game doesn't happen like that. If I wanted to be that way, I would love for it to be. I have to do what's best for our team to help put our team in a position to win ballgames. That's the only thing I can control. \n\n Q. How much does all this stuff around you seep through to you in your mind when you're by yourself just hanging out? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: The losses do. That's all it's about for me, winning and losing. Of course, I get on myself, I'm hard on myself about wanting to play well, because I feel like that's what I need to do for my teammates. But to answer questions about what's written about me or anything like that, I don't really feed into it. It's going to be written no matter what, no matter if I play well or not. I had a triple-double last game. I had a bad game in a lot of people's eyes. I understand that. That's just the situation I'm in. That's the bowl I'm in right now. I can only satisfy my teammates. That's the way I look at it. \n\n Q. LeBron, there's a video circulating that's gathered some buzz about you and Dwyane pretending to be sick, and there's been a lot of interpretations about what that was all about. Can you tell us what was going on. \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I'm not feeding into that. If you guys want to feed into everything that not only myself or D-Wade or the Miami Heat do, I think that's a non-issue. There's bigger issues in this series than that. \n\n Q. LeBron, earlier this season when you and Dwyane said you guys had figured it out offensively, you said you weren't thinking about him, you were thinking about what you needed to do and you weren't worried about him getting his touches, you were worried about how you personally played. Now that you're in The Finals, are you overthinking whether Dwyane is feeling it and you don't want to disrupt that? Or are you going away from what you guys did to get figured out? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I don't think so. I think we have figured it out in the sense of what makes our team successful. Just like in the last series, I feel like D-Wade was out of rhythm, I just tried to pick it up offensively. And it's kind of vice versa right now. I haven't been in a good rhythm offensively. He's tried to pick it up. Guys have tried to pick it up in my absence offensively. That doesn't mean that we're back to square one. We've worked to playing too many games to go back to square one. If I make a few plays here, make a few plays there, then the whole course changes from me being 8-for-19 last game to being 10-for-19. You just got to be able to stick through it, watch film and figure out ways that you can help this team win offensively, because that's what it's about also. \r\n THE MODERATOR: Thanks, LeBron. \n\n ",
  "Q. LeBron, you called this game the biggest of your career. Are you struggling at all with the pressure of The Finals, the pressure of the fourth quarter? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: No, I don't think so. I don't believe so. I know I'm not. We as a team, we played good enough to win again. Put ourself in position to win down the stretch. Everyone, guys made plays. They just made a few more than we did. That's what it came down to. \n\n Q. Do they need more offense from you in the fourth quarter? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I don't think it was a case of offense again tonight. There was enough offensive play. We shot 52%, they shot 56%. We scored 103 points, they scored 112. The offense wasn't a problem. \n\n Q. You guys suffocated Derrick Rose and Jet in the fourth quarter of Game 1. Last two games Jet fourth quarter outscored you 16-2. Is he wearing you guys down? Is he just getting different looks? Why has Jet been able to explode in these last two fourth quarters? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: He made big shots. He made some great three-point shots tonight. A hand contested in his face. Some of them was open. He's just aggressive. We always said when he plays well, they're very tough to beat. That's what he's done the last two games. \n\n Q. Dwyane, can you take us through your injury and the challenge you had getting back on the floor both times. \r\n DWYANE WADE: You know, I'm not going to do that. I don't talk about injuries. It was unfortunate I had to leave the game. But I came back and I finished it. \n\n Q. Was it really hard to play through that? \r\n DWYANE WADE: No, once you're on the court, you're on the court. I don't have no excuses. I was on the court. I was able to help my team get an opportunity to win. And I'll be fine Sunday. \n\n Q. Erik came in here and said the thing you guys need to do the most over the next day and a half is work through the idea of closing out games. What did you learn in that stretch in March about closing out games that you can apply now? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Well, it starts defensively. We've had a few breakdowns late in games in this series that we didn't have in the first three series. So it's something we know we can do. We just got to push through it. At this point we have no choice, honestly. We got two games left, and we worked hard all year to get home-court advantage. So we have to take advantage of it. \n\n Q. Dwyane, how much pride do you guys take in closing out games? And what does it mean to you not to have been able to do it in these few? \r\n DWYANE WADE: It's unfortunate. Obviously we put ourselves in a position on the road especially to win games. We haven't been able to do that. That's been our staple. That's the reason we're here. The good thing about life and the good thing about this game, we get another opportunity, another crack at it. \r\n We know it's the thing that's going to either lose or win us a championship. It comes down to either not closing out games or closing it out. We have another game Sunday to be able to do that. \n\n Q. LeBron, what was the adjustment process like for you guys once Dwyane was out? Obviously coming out and starting the third quarter without him is not anything you guys are accustomed to doing. \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Just try to work our same offense. I was able to get into the lane a couple of times, hit out for threes, hit out for guys that got some lay-ups, and also I was able to get to the rim a couple of times, put a little pressure on the defense. But it's nothing that you really can change. It's our habits we've been working through all season. With him being out, we just try to do the same thing as if he was in, but knowing that one of our scorers is down. But guys had to come in and try to make plays and pick up the slack while he was out. \n\n Q. Dwyane, that's something you've dealt with before. Is there a confidence level you'll be able to bounce back with treatment and everything like that for Game 6? \r\n DWYANE WADE: Yeah, no problem at all. I'll be good for Game 6. Like I said, I feel our team did a great job while I was out. We have a team that's deep enough that can make things happen. Mike Miller did a great job and enabled me to get more treatment in the back, so I could come back and finish out the game. \n\n Q. Dwyane, did you have any doubt you would be able to return? Spo said he had some doubt when you weren't out there to start the second half. \r\n DWYANE WADE: No, everybody know me -- at that point just trying to come out. The doctor not ruling me out, I can come out and help my team with my presence on the floor. I'm smart enough to play the game without obviously being 100%. That's all I did when I came back. I want to help us get back in this ballgame, and I was able to be effective in a sense. \n\n Q. LeBron, you said many times that your stats are irrelevant to you. Is that true at all with a triple-double, or does that rule still apply? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Absolutely. The only thing that applies to me is a win. A win or a loss. I could have made a couple more plays for my team. But at the end of the day, all it's about is a win or a loss. Triple-double means absolutely nothing in a loss. So we will be better in Game 6 on Sunday. \n\n Q. LeBron, in the two games you guys have won, Jason Terry didn't score a single point in the fourth quarter. In the games that they won, he scores eight or nine. Going forward, how much do you take on yourself to really shut him down in the fourth quarter? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Like I said, it's never a one-on-one matchup. I said that when he was struggling in the first couple of games, the games that we won. I said it's never a one-on-one matchup. JT is the reason why, like I said, in the top vote-getters of Sixth Man of the Year every year. He does a great job of staying active, staying in rhythm and they get him the ball in the fourth quarter. \r\n So I take pride in it. Like I said, I'm not going to always stop him or hold him under his average. I would hope so. He gets enough looks, he gets enough cracks at it, he's going to make a few in. We have to make sure we stay locked in and not allow him to get open ones like he had tonight. \n\n Q. LeBron, in the second quarter there seemed to be a concerted effort to get the ball to you in the post. They seemed to get away from that in the second half. Why did you get away from it and did you think about going down low in the stretch particularly with three minutes left when things were tight? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Honestly, we just worked our game. I was able to get the ball in the post a few times in the first half. It worked. Some of them didn't work. Second half with D-Wade being out to start the second half, I took it upon to be a little more of a ball-handler, get guys into our offense. \r\n But we just try to take what the defense gives us. We have nothing to say about our offense tonight. We shot 53% from the floor. These guys shot 57. Shot almost 70% from the three-point line. Offensively had nothing to do with why we lost this game. We just couldn't get enough stops down the stretch. \n\n Q. LeBron, at 102-100 you had the ball at the top and you took a three there. Did you think about maybe trying to drive by him, or was he giving you so much space that was the best play? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I didn't think about it. D-Wade gave it to me, I had enough room and I shot it. Shots I made before. I just didn't make it that time. \n\n Q. D-Wade, you went through this in '06. You know how funny momentum can be. Now that they have this momentum, even though they're going to your home floor, how difficult is it going to be to stop them now that they have everyone operating on all cylinders? \r\n DWYANE WADE: Well, I mean, obviously they're a tough team to guard. Like we said, they're the best offensive team in this game. But I guess they have momentum in the sense they came home and won two games. But each game is its own. We're going to come out -- every game has been pretty much a possession here, a possession there. Either team can come in and say they can be up different than what they are. We'll be coming to the game understanding it's a possession game in Game 6. Doing whatever it takes to win the ballgame. So we're confident. \n\n ",
  "Q. LeBron, you're a two-way player, of course. At what point do you in the fourth quarter say, one guy on their team is killing us. I'm going to go guard that guy, and the guy is Dirk? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I don't think -- what do you mean? We have matchups. We have schemes. It's not one guy that's hurting us. I think Tyson Chandler had an unbelievable game last night. Offensive rebounds, he had nine offensive rebounds. Dirk made shots. He can make shots against anyone. He can make shots against me. He can make shots against anyone in this league. Just try to make it hard on him. We did that. \n\n Q. LeBron, I've never heard you make an excuse, fatigue as an excuse ever in your career. But you've played the full second half of every game for the last month, almost. Is your energy level where you need it to be at the very end of these games? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: You can always use -- if you can get a minute or two minutes there, it helps anyone. It would help me as well. I feel like I'm in condition where I can still be effective. I just have to figure a way I can be effective on both ends of the floor. Last night, you know, eight points is definitely inexcusable for myself. I hold myself up to a higher standard than that. I had to do a better job of putting myself in situations where I can benefit myself and my team, no matter how many minutes I'm out on the floor. \n\n Q. LeBron, we've seen you in the last couple of rounds just take over fourth quarters against Boston, against Chicago, put teams away. So obviously you know how to do that, when to do that. When you say after a game like last night, I wasn't aggressive enough, how does that happen? How does it get to a point whether you're lulled into something or you just kind of get lost? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: You're at a point where you just not in a good rhythm. You start aiming shots, you start thinking about plays too much. You start thinking about the game too much and instead of going out and reading and react and playing the game. It happens to all of us where you get to a point where you feel so out of rhythm, you try to impact the game some other way than offensively. I try to rebound the ball, try to defend. If I wasn't -- had it going offensively, just trying to get guys to defend, to play two on the ball where I can give it up to someone so someone else can make the play. \r\n When you're out of rhythm, it's tough to get back into the flow in that particular game. I guess the best thing about it is you try to watch that film, see the things you can do better the next game and then go after it.\n\n Q. Scoring aside, it looked like times you weren't even involved in the play. Is that unusual? And is that because as you said, if you were struggling do you kind of withdraw a little bit? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: You just have to pick your spots. At times -- I watched the film again last night when I got back to the room. I watched the film today with the whole unit, and there were times I definitely could have attacked. When you're out of rhythm, I guess it feels like you have nothing going offensively. You just try to focus your play somewhere else. \r\n At the same time I have to make sure I keep myself active, some way, somehow. Getting offensive rebound, the put-back, cutting when someone else has the ball. Figure out a way to still be effective even if I'm not bringing the ball up or initiating the offense. \n\n Q. LeBron, throughout Dwyane's time with Miami, he's always taken pains, it seems like, to get guys involved early. Together you guys have taken the same approach all season. Does tomorrow have to be a night where you come out from the word \"go\" and start looking for your shots first and opposed to getting other guys necessarily involved? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I think it's that time. I think it's that time that I try to get myself going individually. But at the same time still play my game. And when I say be more aggressive, that doesn't mean be more aggressive and have to shoot the ball. It just means being more aggressive and looking for opportunities to get a look. And if I bring two defenders and give the ball up. That's something I've done my whole career. Still be aggressive but at the same time get guys involved and have to do that. \n\n Q. With all the things that have been said over the last 11 months or whatever it is, DeShawn Stevenson was saying today that he thought you checked out in the fourth quarter. At this point in the year does something like that even matter much? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I like when I smile and the flashes go off and -- it's pretty cool. (Laughter).\r\n Like I said, I'm not -- DeShawn, he's been talking for a long time, since out Washington-Cleveland days. I don't let that get to us. Those guys are playing well. We're playing well. It's a three-game series. Talk is cheap. You have to play the game of basketball. Let the scores and the plays define the game. We don't get caught up in that too much. \n\n Q. LeBron, you watched extra film last night and with the team today you did that and you'll practice today. What else are you going to do to use the time until tip-off tomorrow night to become different in Game 5? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Just mental. It's just a mental -- your mind state going into the game tomorrow night. You watch film, you watch too much. You don't want to drag on what happened last night. You get into the books, you get into your studies, and then you move on. It's a new day. Tomorrow is a new game. And just like when we moved on from Game 2 to Game 3, we will move on from Game 4 to Game 5 and try to come out with a better outcome. \n\n Q. Is there anything that helps you do that? Music? Talking to anyone in specific? Things like that? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: No. Not really. Just being back on the court. Just rushing the opportunity to be back -- having another opportunity. If it was the Super Bowl, I would be kicking myself in the foot. We have one game. That's it. The great thing about this, it's a series. No matter if you can have a bad game, you can always make an imprint on the next game. Game 5 is a huge game. \n\n Q. LeBron, we know since last summer you've been criticized for so many things, some of them fair, some not fair, are you saying everything that was said or written about last night, is that mostly fair? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I haven't read anything that was written. I didn't play well, especially offensively. I know that. I've got to do a better job of helping this team win basketball games, especially late, no matter what it is. If that's getting an offensive rebound, like I said, making a couple of baskets, being more aggressive to give my guys opportunities to get open looks. I have to do that. That's what my job is. That's what I'm here for. \n\n Q. Do you fall into a trap sometimes knowing now you have more help than you ever had, sometimes you don't think you have to have it going right away? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: You can. Because you know you have other guys. You have other options. You feel like you don't have to take over games. You don't have to take as many shots. Sometimes you can get out of rhythm doing it. I think we've all seen that at this point -- at some point this year. Kind of waiting and waiting and waiting, and then it gets to a point you're just out of rhythm. We've all been through that. But we figured it out through games, through practices, how we can all be effective at the same time. And we need to put it together now. \n\n Q. LeBron, when you go through some struggles, do you almost relish the opportunity to come back from them when things don't come easily? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I have. Both series, the Boston series and the Chicago series, there was a couple of games I didn't play well. You come back and you just do better the next game. I understand that I have the ability to go out there, my teammates give me all the confidence in the world to go out there and try to help them win a basketball game. You definitely relish the next moment. I'm looking forward to it. \n\n Q. LeBron, with your pick-and-roll offense, a lot of times the guy on the weak side is sort of in the parking lot a little and it takes away from the dynamic of you and Dwyane. Is there something you guys can do so you're both active more often? How hard is it to be that guy sort of in the parking lot there who is not necessarily involved to keep yourself in the play? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: It's a challenge. But at the same time like I said, you have to figure out a way to still be active in the offense. That's cutting behind the defense and making yourself closer to the ball. You have to do that. D-Wade does a great job sometimes of cutting baseline getting dunks, getting lay-ups. I try to flash behind the defense at times when I don't have the ball necessarily and get some looks for myself or for my teammates. \r\n You can't ever feel like you're not in the offense even though you're on the weak side. You always have to be like the ball is coming to me, the ball is coming to me even when it's all the way on the other side. You have to stay in tune with whatever is going on if that instance. \n\n Q. LeBron, you're a competitive guy and I know you're going to move on and yesterday is yesterday and Game 1 is Game 1, but with yesterday's point total and the loss, were you bothered? Are you upset? Ticked off? What was the emotion after the game even though you may have gotten over it today? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Absolutely. I criticized myself. I was hard on myself all last night. Anytime I feel like I could have played better and the team loses, that's what it's all about. If I have a bad game and we win, I'm hard on myself, but at the end of the day we win the basketball game. That's ultimately what it's all about. When we lose and I don't play well, and I feel like I could have did one or two more things to help our team win or get over the hump, you're definitely hard on yourself. That's just me. That's just the make-up of who I am. \n\n Q. I don't know if you know the answer to this, LeBron, I certainly don't. I didn't check the tape. Do you have any clue how many times you got in the paint last night? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I have no idea. \n\n Q. It didn't seem like a lot, though, did it? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: There's always opportunities you feel like you can get more in the paint. I had a few times -- I can always get more, be more aggressive. I said that last night after the game. I have to be more aggressive, even if that takes for me getting out in the open court sometimes, getting the rebound, getting out in the open court where I'm at my best or playing in the post. I'm playing a lot in the post, too. So I'm in the paint there. They're bringing double-teams, I'm able to get it out to a lot of our shooters. \r\n I don't know the exact number. \n\n Q. LeBron, how early or late into the game did you realize that you didn't have it offensively the way you wanted? And what bothered you most about what you did or didn't do last night? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I don't know at what instance I felt like I was out of rhythm. I think what bothered me the most is that it resulted in me being out of rhythm. It resulted in us having a loss. That's what it's all about for me. At no point should I ever feel like I'm out of rhythm, because my teammates key on me and they look at me to come through for them. \r\n There's times when you're out of rhythm, it's hard to get back into it. But you have to figure out a way to still be an impactful player on both ends of the floor. Like I said, if that's getting a defensive stop, if that's creating a charge defensively, or getting an offensive rebound to get us another possession, you have to figure out those ways to do it to help your team win. \r\n I didn't do that last night. Those are the things that I pride myself on that hurt me the most. I'll just be hard on myself and figure out a way to do it better the next game. \r\n THE MODERATOR: Thanks, LeBron. \n\n ",
  "Q. Dwyane, first of all, talk about the rhythm you got in into tonight. And also talk about the free throw and what was going through your mind during both of them. \r\n DWYANE WADE: The rhythm just, trying to make plays, maybe get to the basket, make some things happen. I can't shoot the free throw any better than I did. It went in and came out. The basketball gods didn't want it to go in. When you put yourself in a situation where you practice on that moment, you thought about that moment, you go out there and you shoot them like you normally do. That's what I did. It eventually came out. \r\n It wasn't because I wasn't ready for the moment or haven't been in that moment. The basketball gods just had other plans. \n\n Q. In that last play, what was called? And go through that. \r\n DWYANE WADE: The last play when Mike wound up being there? \n\n Q. Yes. \r\n DWYANE WADE: We had many different options to look for. I was denied. I came back off another screen. I saw an opening. Mike threw the ball and I was trying to get to the opening, probably before I caught it. That's how I lost it. Just trying to get the ball back before it went over half court. \r\n So obviously we would like better execution. But it was a great pass. I just fumbled it because -- I was kind of anxious because I saw an opening really fast, trying to get there before I caught the ball. Obviously I would love to have that play back. We would love to have a lot of plays back. It happened. It was unfortunate. \n\n Q. LeBron, could you talk about your offensive night. And did you defer too much? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Definitely didn't play great offensively. I got to do a better job of being more assertive offensively, not staying out of rhythm offensively the whole game. But I think one thing I try to concentrate is, if I get two guys on me, try to make my teammates better, hit those guys for open looks. They made some great looks, but at the same time I have to keep myself in rhythm while I'm doing that as well. \n\n Q. LeBron, in the last series when Dwyane said he felt his shot was out of rhythm, he came to the gym extra and shot. What are some of the things you're going to do over the next day and a half to be a better player in Game 5? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: You know, with these games, every other day, there's not much gym time you can have. You want to try to stay off your feet as much as possible. If I feel like I need to come to the gym and get some extra shots up, I will. Absolutely just to get my shot back going and my confidence with my shot going. If I feel I need to do that after practice, tomorrow night I will do that. \n\n Q. Where do you feel your confidence is with your shot right now? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I'm confident with my ability. It's about going out there and knocking them down. When you have the opportunity, you have to knock them down. Your teammates give you the confidence. They give me the confidence all year, all postseason. So I have to go out there and make them count. \n\n Q. Dwyane, lately seems like you're taking it upon yourself to do everything. Rebounding, defending at the rim. Describe this added responsibility it seems like you're taking on. \r\n DWYANE WADE: Just trying to make plays. My teammates and my team count on me to be more than one-dimensional. So obviously I'm in an offensive rhythm. It's just one side of the ball. On the other end of the floor my matchup is to chase Jason Terry around. I have to do that. If I'm off the ball I try to be more active. Just make plays. Sometimes it results in blocks or steals or rebounds. \r\n It's The Finals. You just want to make sure every night you leave the court you feel like you left it all out there. It's not always going to be a positive result, but at the end of the day, if you feel like you left it all out there, you can be satisfied with the result. \r\n Obviously we didn't win the game. We had an opportunity. But I felt that we played very hard. We did some of the things that we wanted to do. Too many turnovers in the fourth quarter as a team. Myself, I had two. But we gave ourself a chance. That's the only thing we came here to do. \n\n Q. LeBron, you guys had a commanding lead in the fourth. You guys would have gone up 3-1. Mavericks had nothing going. Shooting a low percentage. Dirk was sick. How do you think you guys ended up losing this game? What happened? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I don't think anything is commanding in this series. These are two games teams trying to figure out a way to make plays down the stretch. We've seen in this series seven or eight-point lead is nothing. You just got to continue to execute offensively, continue to grind defensively. And put yourself in the best possible chance to win late. \n\n Q. LeBron, what were they specifically showing you defensively that didn't let you get going offensively? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I think they haven't changed their coverages on me. Me just being more assertive, that's what it's about. I got the ball in the post a few times, and I seen double-teams. I tried to kick it out to guys and they've made shots for us. At the same time I can't let that stop my aggression when they bring two on the ball. I still got to make plays for my team, but also make plays for myself to keep me in the rhythm of the game. \n\n Q. Obviously this is a game you guys feel like you let get away. Dirk going 6-for-19. Other guys stepping up for them. Do you feel like this could be a game where their supporting cast comes into the series? And how difficult is that going to be to combat in Game 5? \r\n DWYANE WADE: Obviously, we had opportunity to win the ballgame. The one thing about this series, you see no team is ever safe. When it looks like one team may be in control of the game, the other team comes back. So that's why it's a 48-minute game. Obviously their supporting cast did a good job. They've been getting pounded by you guys for the last 48 hours. So there's a lot of pride. They came out and played well. They had a lot of different guys do a lot of good things. \r\n We give them credit where credit is due. But we also learn from it and we will come back and try to get Game 5. \n\n Q. LeBron, single digits probably the last thing you expected tonight. I think for the first time in your playoff career. What's the emotion right now? Is it anger? Is it frustration? Is it letting it go? Is it some combination? How can you sum up what's going through you right now?\r\n LeBRON JAMES: I think the fact that it happened in a loss is the anger part about it. That's all that matters to me. If I had had eight points and we won the game, I could be satisfied. I don't really care about that. The fact I could have did more offensively to help our team, that's the anger part about it, and myself. I'll come back in Game 5 and do things that needs to be done to help our team win. \n\n Q. LeBron, talk about that momentum-building inspiration to come back, because you didn't do that well tonight. How will it inspire you to come back even stronger with more of a vengeance? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: We've always been a good bounce-back team. Anytime we have a loss or we feel like we could have did better in one game, we've always been able to bounce back. Individuals have been able to bounce back, including myself, D-Wade and CB and the guys. We understand it's a golden opportunity. Game 5 we come here and we play as well as we did tonight, we execute a little better down the stretch, we give ourselves a good chance to win Game 5 and go home and be able to close out. \n\n Q. Talk about the competition between you and Jason Terry. He came out inspired. \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Jason Terry is a great player. When he plays well, Dallas plays well. He's the reason why these guys are in The Finals and that's the reason why he's been one of the top guys and Sixth Man Award every year, because he plays well for this team. \r\n It's a good show tonight by both teams. They made one or two more plays down the stretch than we did. We look forward to Game 5, and try to come out here with a win. \n\n ",
  "Q. LeBron, I'll just ask you the same thing: Can you give me a few adjectives? What did Chris Bosh's eye look like during that game? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: It didn't look well. All game you could see it watering. You could see him messing with it. Just trying to keep a tissue during time-outs to keep it padded. But he fought through it. And then you definitely respect that. \n\n Q. Have you guys seen growth from him? Dwyane has talked about seeing growth all year. What growth have you seen during this series? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: CB is really hard on himself. He's his own critic. He knows when he's not playing well. As teammates we try to keep him upbeat, let him understand how important he is to this team. He's grown. Not only just this series but throughout the whole postseason. This is the furthest he's ever played in a postseason. So he's excited, and he's done some great things for our team. He's going to continue to do great things for our team. We always say he's the most important player to our team. \n\n Q. LeBron, you score in Game 1, you guys win. Yesterday you're a distributor at the end you guys win, but still there's LeBron stories and LeBron criticism. Are you at the point you feel like you can't win? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: No, I did win. We won. (Laughter). That's all that it's about. \r\n You know me, anybody that knows me throughout the years, all I care about is the W. No matter if I'm scoring. I'm not just a scoring guy. I've got a lot of points in my career. I have had some teammates who have given me great confidence and ability to go out there and score a lot of points. But I've done other things. I don't have to score points to be effective. \r\n Not only did Chris Bosh make the game-winning shot, but D-Wade had a hockey assist. I got the assist to CB and Udonis Haslem set the screen on Dirk to get him a wide-open shot. That's what it's about. This is a team game. Even though I know I get a lot of the headlines, bad headlines, D-Wade gets a lot of the great headlines, CB gets a few headlines, this is a team game. We understand as a team we have to play together to win. It's not just about me. \n\n Q. Adjustment-wise they changed Jason Terry against you, getting him the ball a little bit earlier in Game 2. Now they've struggled a little bit at the end of games with your guys' defense. Actually at the beginning getting big deficits. What adjustments do you expect now for tomorrow night? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I don't think it can't be too many. I think there are slight adjustments both teams make from game to game. Like I said, Game 4 of The Finals, which you've been working on all season since training camp is what you have. There's not too many things you can change. You can make slight tweaks offensively, defensively that can make you be a little bit more on point when you see a situation happens. But right now it's about the team that's going to play hard, going to use their instincts and just play on a string. You have to trust one another as teammates both ends. Not only us, but Dallas as well. \n\n Q. LeBron, you and Dwyane have talked recently especially you don't care who finishes the game as long as you win. How did that process develop this year? And was there a point in the season where you stopped worrying about what the perception was out there? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I think when our communication just -- we didn't care about -- it's all about winning. Once we started communicating that -- I think it started early in the season when we just were struggling. We were trying to be too unselfish. I've always said that trying to change our game, I thought that was going to be for the better of the team. \r\n At the end of the day, we had always just say whoever has it going, we kind of just go to. D-Wade had it going last night. I have had it going at points in this postseason where they've come to me, come to me and I've been able to close for our team. \r\n It doesn't matter. At the end of the day, it's the win. If it's D-Wade making a crucial basket or me making a crucial basket or last night, CB making the game-winning shot, that's all that's about. \n\n Q. I know you're somebody who cares a lot about legacy. You've had series in your career where you put up big numbers and not won the series. Do you care about what your numbers will look like when it's over? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: No, I just want to win. Individual, I think my individual stats will take care of itself. Like you said, in a series I've averaged 38 points a game and we've lost in the Eastern Conference Finals against Orlando. \r\n This is a team game. My resume will speak for itself after I'm done with this game of basketball. What me and my teammates are trying to accomplish now is the only thing I'm worried about. When I'm done, I'll let you guys figure where I should be placed. \n\n Q. LeBron, you had to get past Boston obviously in an earlier round to get here, and stopping them with your defense against their offense. Any way the Mavericks here compare to the options that Boston has? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: They're very similar, because they force you to help -- they have so many dynamic players on the court at one time. You look at Boston, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Rondo, these four guys can all break you down at one time. So everyone is live. You can't relax off anyone of them because they'll all make you pay. That's the same with this Dallas Mavericks team. When you are coming down the stretch and you have Jason Kidd and Jason Terry, with Dirk also and Shawn Marion and Tyson Chandler who also can create things off the glass, you never have a chance to relax, ever. So mentally you have to be in tune, because if you do, like we've done a few times in this series, they make you pay. \n\n Q. LeBron, for years you played against Dwyane and probably in some cases guarded him. What's the difference between him now in '11 and when he was in '05 and '06 in the years you've seen him? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I think the difference is he had a super duper green light. Like he told you before, he had no conscience in '06. He knew that he really had to go out and score 30 every night to give his team a chance to win at times. He's a smarter player now. That just comes with age. It comes with experience. It comes with games that you play throughout the course of your years. \r\n I mean, he's the same great player I faced my first seven years in the league. A guy that can break you down off the dribble, create at the rim, can make shots from the outside. At the same time, a two-way player who also plays defense at the same high intensity. I just think he's a little older, but not old at all. Just a little older. \n\n Q. LeBron, even though you guys knew when you decided to make all this happen, you guys knew there would be times where you would share all kinds of roles, be it the ball at the end or the leadership, did it take you some get getting used to when Dwyane could be vocal, be harsh with you? You probably haven't had that a whole lot in your life. Did it take you time to get used to? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Not at all. I've never been afraid of constructive criticism. From my coaches, from my high school teammates. I had four best friends in my high school team. Those guys would get on me all the time if I ever did anything wrong. Something I've been going through my whole life. When you have good friends and you have friends they are not afraid to tell you when you're wrong. That's on the court or off the court when you're doing stuff that shouldn't be done. So it wasn't hard to adjust to. I understand that if he's yelling at me or trying to tell me to do something better, it's for the better of the team, to help me get better individually, vice versa. \r\n It didn't take no time to get used to. I know I'm not bigger than this team or I know everything. I still got a lot of improvement to do. \n\n Q. LeBron, you mentioned you've been to the Finals before. Experience-wise, is there a difference between being in The Finals or winning the Finals? And when I say that, have you noticed anything different with Wade even though you've known him for so long in these three games? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: The only difference for me in '07 and now, it takes a lot more preparation. Being young, I wasn't ready for the preparation for the NBA Finals at that point. Being my first time. I wasn't prepared mentally. Coming into this season, I prepared from day one. Being around two guys who had already won rings, three guys including Eddie House and Udonis and D-Wade, I knew how to prepare throughout the course of the season to get to this point. \r\n So it is great when you are around guys who have been in this moment and who actually got to the mountaintop, to lean on at times. We have a luxury. We have a luxury here. We got guys that have been in this moment before and not afraid to be in it again. \r\n THE MODERATOR: Thanks, LeBron. \n\n ",
  "Q. For either one of you guys: After Game 2, Dirk said you can't win a game like that and come back on your home floor and lose Game 3. Do you guys feel like this win does anything emotionally, psychologically to this team to the Mavs? \r\n DWYANE WADE: That's awesome, because we felt the same way. You can't lose a game like that and come and lose Game 3. We felt this was a must-win. We had to put it upon ourselves to try to take home court back in a sense, and by any means necessary. \r\n So it was a big win for us, but it was a big game. I thought we did a good job of withstanding all their runs, withstanding the points in the game where it looked like they had momentum. And we held on to our lead and we made enough plays to win the ballgame. \n\n Q. LeBron, we've seen you keep going at guys even if they're having cold shooting nights. Describe that mentality in particular as applied to Bosh tonight, wasn't having a great night and the game on the line, you gave him the ball. \r\n LeBRON JAMES: It's all about trusting your teammates. D-Wade, we ran a two-three pick-and-roll. They put two on the ball. D-Wade hit me first. I had Tyson Chandler closing on me. I saw CB wide open. I don't care if he missed 15 in a row, he was wide open and that's his sweet spot. He was able to knock it down. It's the trust we have in each other's ability, no matter what the point of the game is at. \n\n Q. For both you guys, a lot of what the Mavericks do starts on the perimeter a long ways from the basket. Seemed like tonight you pushed farther and farther out to make what they were doing at the beginning of plays tougher and you created a lot of turnovers on the perimeter. Is that because you don't have a fear of what happens against this team closer to the basket? Does that make sense? Are they so perimeter-driven by how they run their offense and shooting so many jumpshots that it makes it easier on you guys to take chances out high? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: It's not even that. We play our defense. This is the toughest offense we've played all year as far as how many guys they put on the floor that can make plays. Not only for themselves, but for others. Unbelievable shooting team. And they make you stay in tune. You can never relax or they make you pay. Our defense always tries to extend offenses further than where they usually start. That's just our defense. It has nothing to do about them not being a paint presence or anything like that. It's just our defense. That's how we played all postseason all year. \n\n Q. Dwyane, can you talk about the urgency you played with tonight? Especially with the rebounding. You were really aggressive going towards the boards. \r\n DWYANE WADE: Yeah, just understanding the moment. Took it upon myself as a leader to try to lead my guys by example. And I think for me it started in practice yesterday. I was very aggressive going to the hole practicing. My teammates seen it. They can tell that I wanted this game, and I came in with the same mentality today. Just trying to -- like I said, I've been here before. So just trying to lead. My guys did a great job of following that lead. We were able to come out with the win. \n\n Q. LeBron, three games in a row for you fourth quarter, not much. That's the moment superstars become superstars. Seems like you are almost shrinking from it. What's going on? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I think you're concentrating on one side of the floor. All you're looking at is the stat sheet. Honestly, I'm a two-way player. Since D-Wade had it going offensively, so we allow him to handle the ball, bring it on offensively. You should watch the film again and see what I did defensively. You'll ask me a better question tomorrow. \n\n Q. What did you guys think, and can you tell me what was going through your minds as you watched with just seconds left on the clock, Dirk heading towards the basket once again. It was almost a replay of what happened the last game. What went through your minds there? \r\n DWYANE WADE: Obviously, you know, we have a lot of confidence in our team defense. That was a man-to-man defense right there. It was Udonis putting his chest in front. We had a lot of confidence coming out of the huddle. We wanted to win this game right now on the defensive end with that stop. Even more confidence than we had if we were down two or tied and had it on the offensive end. \r\n I was very confident in UD, understanding he wanted that challenge the last game, and he wasn't able to be put in that position. Put him back in that position this time. I knew he was going to at least make it tough. If Dirk makes the shot, at least do his job and make sure he takes a fadeaway at the end. \n\n Q. LeBron, what did you think when you saw it? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Like D-Wade said, we had all the confidence in the world in our defensive scheme. UD wanted that matchup in Game 2. So we knew when he got this matchup, he was going to make Dirk take a tough shot. He made that shot before. He will make it again. At least we just make him work for it. Make him take a turn-around jumper. UD stayed in front of him and it rimmed out. It was a huge stop for our team. \n\n Q. LeBron and Dwyane, talk about how much of a redemption winning this game in Dallas is after losing that big game at home. How does it give you guys confidence going forward in Game 4? \r\n DWYANE WADE: Well, confidence, you get to this point with neither team confidence won't be an issue. Obviously it's a great road win. We got three games in a row here. So it's good to get the first one. Personally, I moved on from this win already. I feel like we did nothing but get home-court advantage back. But the next game is a big game. We have to bring our hard hats, understanding it's going to be tougher to win that game than it was to win this one. I believe in this team. If anyone can do it, I believe we can. \n\n Q. Dwyane, you got a bit feisty out there today, whether it was talking to LeBron at one time in the fourth quarter, admonishing Chris to a degree. Can you talk about the spirit you have. It seemed for a while you guys were on pins and needles, you came together friendly-like. It seems like today you said, we need this. Can you discuss those what got those emotions going? And LeBron can you talk about when Dwyane got in your face a little bit, what's that experience like? \r\n DWYANE WADE: Them guys understand. They know me. I understand them. If things are said to each other, it's all in the better for the team. It's all about winning. I want it. LeBron knew that. The things I was saying to him, I was saying to Chris, wasn't nothing they wouldn't say to me. It was something they would say to me in the Chicago series and vice versa. We have enough respect for each other. At the same time, I wanted it. \r\n I was just trying to help them guys and feel like ways that they can be better to help our team be better at that moment and vice versa. They do the same to me. I don't know if I got in his face, but I was just trying to do what leaders do and do what captains do. Step up and say what you feel at that point in order.\n\n Q. LeBron, it doesn't seem like there have been many teammates who feel empowered enough to do that. What's that moment like and what's it like having a teammate that, heck, at this moment I'm going to tell you what I need to tell you whether you're LeBron James or just the 12th guy on the roster? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: It's just we're teammates. At this point there's no room to hold anything back. There's nine or eight days left in the season. I think our friendship allows us to don't care about that moment. It's living in the moment. That situation he had every right to say what he had to say to me. As a competitor, you love when guys challenge you. He challenged me in the locker room at halftime. He challenged me on the court. As a competitor, like I said, I respect that. \n\n Q. What did he say when he got in your face? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Something that -- I don't know if my kids are asleep right now. \n\n Q. It's midnight. You can say it. \r\n LeBRON JAMES: No, my kids stay up late. \r\n DWYANE WADE: They'll watch ESPN tomorrow. \n\n Q. Dwyane, was it about the offense? Being stagnant or --\r\n DWYANE WADE: It was about winning. \n\n Q. Either for Dwyane or LeBron, it seemed like after the first quarter, Dallas' defense seemed to clamp you guys down. Your offense became stagnant. They held you to 59 the rest of the game and 40%. Was it something they were doing or changes they made, or was it you guys were not flowing as effectively as you were in the first quarter? \r\n DWYANE WADE: I mean, obviously a game of basketball is a game full of runs. So there was moments in the game where offense looked great and their offense looked great. There were points where neither offense looked great. Obviously they did a good job of turning up their pressure. I thought we got ourselves in a little trouble by getting late clock. When we do that, they're able to turn up the pressure. It makes us take bad shots or settle for shots. \r\n We always give teams credit where credit is due. This team worked very hard on the defensive end of the floor. But we could have did a better job and need to do a better job of making sure we don't put ourselves in 9-1-1 situations or turn the ball over and let them get in transitions like they did. \n\n Q. Dwyane, Dirk scored 15 of their last 22. 15 in the fourth quarter. Last game he scored their final nine points. He's been great, but everybody else is not doing much. Is that because you guys are clamping down on other people, or are they missing open looks? \r\n DWYANE WADE: Obviously Dirk is great. A great one-on-one player. A great shooter. We understand Dirk is going to get his numbers. It's our job just to try to make it tough on other guys. They have guys that can score the ball. Shawn Marion has come into this averaging 18 and 9. Jason Terry was huge for them in Game 2 and an unbelievable scorer. They have other guys that can score. It's our job to make it tough. They've shown they have a deep bench. They've shown they have a very good team. They wouldn't be in The Finals without none of them guys. \r\n So we're not going to give Dirk all the credit at all. This Dallas Mavericks team is very deep. \n\n ",
  "Q. LeBron, because everything tends to be bigger with this team and the fall-out over the enjoyment of the moment. Are you concerned that might temper your team's enthusiasm, or are you guys going to savor the moment and if you get emotional, so be it?\r\n LeBRON JAMES: That's part of the game. We're an emotional team. When we make plays, we can congratulate one another. I don't see why this whole thing has been blown out of proportion. I just look at it in the case of I think -- I've seen Dallas go on plenty of runs before. You know, if JT hits a three and they make a big run, if he runs down the court doing the whole wings expanded, do we count that as a celebration as well? I just think everything gets blown out of proportion when the Miami Heat does things. \n\n Q. LeBron, Spo talked after Game 1, and as he has throughout the playoffs, about all you did was win one game. The message clearly being don't get too high. How has this team avoided not getting too low after the game ended? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: It's been our motto, it's been our make-up all year. In the playoffs it's a win or a loss. However it comes by, it's a win or a loss. We've moved on from Game 2, seen the mistakes we've made. Seen some of the great things we've done as well. It's a win or loss. The series is tied 1-1. We never get too high or too low in the series. We haven't gotten too high or low in the regular season as well. We move on to the next challenge and go from there. \n\n Q. LeBron, you've been in a lot of situations in your career where it's been 1-1 after two, regardless of what the format is. Can you talk about how important a Game 3 in that situation is. \r\n LeBRON JAMES: It's very important. We understand that. We are coming out with that mindset, like we had in Game 1 or Game 2. The same mindset. It starts defensively. We have to be in tune as close to 48 minutes as possible, especially versus this team who shoots the ball extremely well, who plays extremely well, especially at home. But it's a sense of urgency. \r\n That's the only way we have approached games. We've never went to a game saying this isn't a must-win for us or it's not a sense of urgency. That's the only way we know how to play, when we feel like we're desperate. It's the only way we approach games. \n\n Q. LeBron, Erik said when he replayed the tape today, he said you guys knew. You identified it immediately. \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Right. \n\n Q. Particularly on defense. Were there things that kept happening over and over, specific things? Was there one thing? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I think it was a few minor breakdowns we don't have. And once those minor breakdowns happened, it allowed them to get into a rhythm. Even though we played great defense in some of the later possessions, they were in a comfort zone at that point. We gave up two wide-open threes without contest to J-Kidd and to Dirk. A wide open lay-up to JT off a missed shot, a missed three, and he got a wide open lay-up. We did a lot of things uncharacteristic. It happened. I don't know why we couldn't score on offense. At the end of the day there's been times we haven't been able to score for quarters on offense, but we've been able to get the stops. That's the make-up of our team. We understand no matter what happens offensively we have to be in tune. We lost our edge. \n\n Q. Now that you guys have been able to watch the film, what was going wrong offensively at the end of the game? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I don't think offensively -- after rewatching the film, we got into a lot of great sets. Besides two or three possessions out of our last 14 possessions, it was pretty good. We had a few shots, I missed a lay-up at the rim. Mario Chalmers missed a wide-open lay-up. We ran some offense where Chris Bosh got in the post. He mishandled it out of bounds. UD got an offensive rebound with a minute left and mishandled it, saved it and they got a lay-up to tie the game. \r\n So we had some really good possessions. They just didn't go down. At the end of the day, that's not where we lost the game. Like I said before, our team -- there has been times we haven't been able to score offensively, but it hasn't stopped us from keeping that same concentration or even more of a concerted effort to play defensively in the game. \n\n Q. What about you personally, when you have a break like this, when there's the off-day and this, are you watching a lot of film? Or is it more you get inside of your own head? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: A little bit of both. I know I'm excited for the game tomorrow. It hurt. We had time to let it hurt us as much as it could yesterday after the game. But today is a new day. And we're back and focused. We're a confident bunch. Me personally, I'm looking forward to the challenge. It's going to be fun. \n\n Q. Do you feel that Shawn Marion has been effective guarding you? And if you feel that way, why so? Also, did you guys anticipate the offense that he would bring, scoring a lot more than he has in the regular season or the last series? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I think Shawn Marion has done a great job. Especially offensively. He's picked up his game offensively. Hanging around the rim, getting some lay-ups, getting some tip-backs, playing around the rim. His activity throughout the first two games has been pretty good. I take it upon myself to not only lock in at the beginning, but whoever is on him to lock in a little bit more. Because he's been very effective. \r\n I don't feel like it's one guy in this league that can stop me one-on-one. There's always a defense that's looking at me when I have the ball. He's the guy that's guarding me, but there's no one-on-one guy that can guard me. \n\n Q. LeBron, you've taken on the challenge of guarding Jason Terry to a lot of effectiveness. There's been a lot of expectation you'll step up and take more of an assignment on Dirk. Have you guys talked about that and come to a plan with that? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Obviously, we look at it as we have enough guys not only can guard Jason Terry, guard Dirk. It's a team thing. It's not LeBron versus Shawn Marion, LeBron versus Dirk Nowitzki or LeBron versus JT or DeShawn Stevenson versus Dwyane Wade. It's not about that. It's about the team. \r\n Even though you have a one-on-one matchup on the court, there's a team defense that's put behind it. So if I get caught on him, it's not like I'm playing him one-on-one. We have a team defense and guys help each other. That's how you become successful in this league by being able to have a back line behind you. When you guard someone as great as Dirk or as great as JT is, you have to have a back line. It's never one-on-one. It's not a one-on-one thing. We get caught up on the one-on-one matchups a lot. There's always a defense that's behind it. \n\n Q. LeBron, you said the offense was working okay but it seemed many times whether it was yourself or Dwyane were taking shots with two or three seconds left on the shot clock. Maybe the ball was a little stagnant. Talk about that, why is that happening? Is it their defense? Also, you've only taken six free throws in two games. I think you're fifth in the NBA this year in free-throw attempts per game. Is it something they're doing? Is it something you're not doing? Can you talk about that as well. \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I think personally I do have to be more aggressive in the paint. Six free-throws in two games -- I do that in my sleep in one game. So that's not me. So I'm going to make a concerted effort to be more aggressive to try to get to the rim, create some more opportunities for myself and my teammates. I understand that. But I think we just had a few -- they extended their defense late in the game. They did some things defensively that they hadn't done throughout the first two games all the way. They started to blitz me, D-Wade's pick-and-rolls, a lot of our sets kept us on the perimeter. We didn't get into our sets early enough to give us more time. So we had to take contested long-range threes. I think I took two. D-Wade actually took one. \r\n So I think the best thing about our team and the best thing about me and D-Wade individually, we get an opportunity to watch the film and know when that happens again, we know how to attack it. And to not settle as much or to get the defense moving a little bit more where we can create not only better shots for ourselves but for our team, and we're not forcing things at the end of the shot clock. \r\n THE MODERATOR: Thanks, LeBron. \n\n ",
  "Q. Guys, Dwyane, when you hit the three to go up 15, LeBron, you kind of started the celebration right in front of the Mavs' bench, which turned into a kind of synchronized handshake in front of the Mavs' bench. Some of the Mavs players mentioned that may have been the turning tide. What were your thoughts on how that all went down? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: It was no celebration at all. I was excited about the fact that he hit a big shot, and we went up 15. The same thing we've done over the course of the season. There was no celebration at all. We knew we had seven minutes to go still to close out the game. \r\n As far as celebration, that word has been used with us all year. But we knew how much time was left in the game still. \n\n Q. Dwyane, did you guys at all when you were up 15 exhale? How do you explain the way that last final minutes went there. \r\n DWYANE WADE: Well, I mean, obviously they played very well. We pride ourselves on the defensive end, and they were able to break us down at the defensive end. And we made some mental mistakes. They got some open shots. We said in the huddle, we were up 15, that this team is very capable of coming back. They've proven it. They've shown it. \r\n So we didn't have to score another point to win the game. Our defense was what we lay our heads on. We didn't play it the way we normally play. They deserved it. And we didn't. \n\n Q. LeBron, you guys seemed to be pounding the ball a bunch at the end instead of running through the offense that got you to that point. Was there a sense sometimes that you felt you can run enough clock and it would end or did you get out of what had been working? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I think offensively we just weren't in a good rhythm. But it's not even -- offensively we've been out of rhythm before. At the end of the day, we hang our hats on our defense. I think they were 1-for-10 the first four or five minutes in the first part of the fourth quarter. It was 88-73; end up scoring 22 points in the last seven minutes. They only scored 24 in the whole fourth. \r\n We're up 15. If they go on a 12-0 run for the rest of the game, if we don't score another basket, we still win by three. Defensively we just have to be more in tune and not allow a great team, a great offensive team to get as many great looks as they did down the stretch. \r\n Jason Kidd had an open three. Jason Terry had a leak-out lay-up. He also had a corner jumper. Dirk 90/90 he hit a wide-open three. That's not our defense at all. We have to do a better job and be more in tune. \n\n Q. At the risk of contradicting you, there was a celebration that was caught on camera, and a few of the Mavericks players said they saw it. It was after Dwyane Wade hit the big three. And while Kidd said he didn't see it, it didn't bother him, Chandler said it didn't, Jet said it did. So maybe we were thinking about different plays, but do you think when players say that motivated them, that's kind of nonsense? What's your take on them saying they were at least somewhat motivated by that celebration? \r\n DWYANE WADE: First of all, every team in the league when they go on a run they do something. Whether it's a signal, whether it's a chest bump. It's a part of the game of basketball. A celebration is confetti, champagne bottles. \r\n There was no celebration. It was a shot made going into a timeout. Every team does something. That's the game. If it pumped them up -- they won the game. Obviously it did something. That's not the first time. It won't be the last time that -- if we do a great play that we come and our teammates and we do something. \r\n Don't make nothing out of that celebration, like you guys did in the Boston series. It's just being excited about the moment. It had nothing to do with the outcome of the game for us. Like you said, defensively we had breakdowns. They made great shots. They made a lot of shots. They're a great team. But we had a lot of breakdowns. \n\n Q. Can you talk about the difference in your mindset from going up with a 2-0 lead, where they have to win four of the last five, to suddenly the series is even, they've regained home-court advantage, and you're going there for the next three? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: It's a different mindset, of course. It's a ballgame now. With the series tied 1-1, we're looking forward to the challenge. It's going to be a difficult challenge for us but we're looking forward to it. We're a confident bunch. We play great on the road. It's going to be a hostile environment. Their fans and team are going to bring everything they have. We have to come out with it all. Play as close to 48 minutes as possible on both ends. \n\n Q. Erik and Chris both said earlier that you guys have tasted this disappointment, this frustration before and have come back repeatedly this season. Can you guys sort of both address where the psyche is and the confidence level is considering that you guys have come back before? \r\n DWYANE WADE: We had breakdowns before throughout this year. We learned from it. That's why we're the team we are. That's why we're in The Finals. Obviously this one hurts, and we got two days to think about our mistakes and blowing a 15-point lead. So we made it a lot harder on ourselves. We're going to see what we're made of as a team. Now we have three straight games on the road, but I wouldn't want to be in this position with any other team. \r\n The things that we've done over the season, the habits that we've built, we're going to lay our hats on it, and we're going to go out there and we're going to, like we said, take each game as its own and get ready for Game 3. \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Absolutely. We're a team that's confident. Every time we have had a pitfall, we've figured out how to bounce back. Right now we have another one. As a veteran ballclub and a team that's been through a lot, we understand how important this next one is with Game 3 being in Dallas and we look forward to the challenge. \n\n Q. For two guys who pride yourselves on defense as much as you guys do, to lose in this particular way, does that get your competitive juices or affect you in a different way than another loss? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: It's not going to affect us for Game 3. It hurts right now because it's right now. We're competitors. We want to win the game. We feel like we have a 15-point lead in the fourth quarter, that our defense will prevail. That's how much confidence we have in our defense. \r\n It hurts now, but we'll be fine. I don't feel like our confidence will be down going into Game 3. We'll be back to square one and figure out how to win the game. \n\n Q. On the other side of this, back in '06, you come back 13 down, six minutes to go. Do you worry now that you guys have let a team that was on the verge of being way out of this thing back into the series and maybe live to regret this? \r\n DWYANE WADE: Well, only time will tell. Obviously you know, we gave them and they gave themselves life. We had opportunities to at least put a little doubt in their mind. They're a confident team. No matter what the outcome of this game, they were going to be confident. It's a different story when you're up 2-0. \r\n You know what? I have been a part of it. I understand once you don't close a team down, they get confidence and life. Like I said, this is a big challenge for us. We're going to have to live up to the challenge, the hole we dug for ourselves, and we're going to see what we're made of as a team. \n\n Q. LeBron, one last thing about the celebration thing: Do you think maybe it's a bigger issue because it happened right in front of their bench, in their personal kind of space, maybe that's why it's a bigger deal than just a normal celebration? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: No, I don't think it's an issue. \n\n Q. For three and a half quarters, what were you doing so well as a team? And are you able to take that moving forward to the next game? Do you think tomorrow you'll be able to put some perspective the last few minutes and say for three and a half quarters we had everything going our way, and we can build off that, as opposed to focusing on the last six minutes? \r\n DWYANE WADE: Yeah. They had 73 points. You know, obviously we felt at certain points in the game where our defense wasn't as crisp as we wanted it to be. A team that scores the ball like this, I thought we were doing a good job. They had 73 points with 7:16, 15 whatever it was left in the ballgame. We put ourselves in a great position. \r\n Offensively I thought we did a great job of getting turnovers and rebounding and getting out in transition and getting easy baskets. That's how we were able to get the lead. Most importantly the reason we had that was because of our defense and the reason we lost the game is because of our defense. \n\n Q. Dwyane, just wanted to get your thoughts on Mike Bibby. When you get a performance from a role player like that, isn't it something where you normally expect to be in contention and win games like that? Just the early shots he was able to hit for you. \r\n DWYANE WADE: Mike, he shot the ball well tonight. That's the Mike Bibby that we love to see. Just shooting it with confidence. It really was big in us coming back, getting the opportunity, getting his hands on a lot of loose balls where we were able to get out in transition. \r\n We want him to continue to shoot with that confidence. He's going to get shots. Obviously this team wants to protect the paint. Want to make sure myself and LeBron, we don't get in the paint. Our shooters are going to get shots. If we can get that production out of Mike Bibby for the rest of the series, we'll be in pretty good shape. \n\n Q. Dwyane and LeBron, both of you, a lot was made of Dirk and his left hand during the week. He finished two of the last three baskets at the rim with his left hand. Can you comment on his ability to go to his off hand when he was hurt at the end of the game when it mattered most? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: We were asked about it after Game 1, I said it would be a non-issue. He's a great scorer. He understands he can use both hands. He got the left-hand lay-up to tie the game up at 90, and then the game-winner going left once again. \r\n So as you can tell, it has no effect on his left hand at all, if any. \n\n Q. Before Dirk's game-winner, did you guys talk about using that foul to give? \r\n DWYANE WADE: We knew coming out we had a foul to give. We knew we didn't have no time-outs. It was a mental breakdown on us. We'll take it. We all said in the huddle, our coaches said it. Sometimes when you're in the moment -- Dirk made a great move to get a little step on Chris. Obviously if we can go back and do it, we would have grabbed him before he could get up. But we didn't do that. We did know about it. Just a mental breakdown. \n\n Q. LeBron, it seemed like the Mavs were trapping you pretty hard coming off screens there at the end of the fourth quarter. Was that differently than they played you the rest of the game? And if not, what exactly bogged down your offense?\r\n LeBRON JAMES: They did. They did a great job of playing two on the ball. They used Tyson Chandler to come off pick-and-rolls, Tyson Chandler or Dirk. They blitzed me and D-Wade's pick-and-roll. Something different. Something we can go to the film to figure out how to exploit that or do a better job of executing later in the game. They didn't do that till the fourth quarter. They picked up the aggression and it got us out of the flow of the offense where we were taking shots at the end of the shot clock. I know I took a few fadeaway threes at the end of the shot clock because we couldn't get into our offense. It's something we'll work on and be better on in Game 3. \r\n THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys. \n\n ",
  "Q. LeBron, you guys are now 6-0 I think when trailing at halftime in these playoffs. You've shown a great knack to come back and win games. Is there a concern of you getting awfully comfortable that, oh, when the fourth quarter comes we'll come back anyway? Is that something you like not have to do? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: It's not like we have big deficits at halftime. I seen the stats last night, down two points to Chicago, three points here, two points to Boston, one point to Boston. It's not like it's a huge deficit that we're trying to come back from 12 or 14 points down. Usually it's just good basketball at this point in time. We happened to be down. \r\n We've played I think -- if I'm doing my math right, we've played 16 games. So we have had ten other games we wasn't trailing. We just got to continue to play our game and not worry about if we're trailing or not. We don't want to trail. We don't want to trail at all throughout the whole game, if it's possible. But we just got to maintain our focus. \n\n Q. LeBron, after the Chicago game, you said that you would not failure team again. What has been the difference late in games and why have you guys, not just you but as a team, been able to close out these games? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Like I said, it comes from failure throughout the season. Having games where we felt like we could or should have won games late in games and we just didn't execute. I said last night I was used to closing out games in the last seven years. CB was used to closing out games and D-Wade was used to closing out games. One thing was figuring out how to do it together. We were used to doing it individually early on in the season. Me making a play or CB making a play or D-Wade making a play going back to our last few years. Once we figured out how we were going to do it together for the better of the team, we started to close games out, figure things out, figure out certain sets that would work for us in late-game situations and go from there. \n\n Q. LeBron, every time you guys have been up in this series, Spo has pretty much stayed with the script, we move on, it's one game. He says all those things. What have you guys learned throughout the playoff run about how important it is to move on that quickly? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: That's what it's about. We understand that Game 1 is over. We played well, but there were some things we could have done better. We now move our focus to Game 2 and approach that game like it's our last as well. We continue to come into our home court and try to protect home court. We understand Dallas if comes in here and does a great job of stealing one of our games, then they feel -- they forget about Game 1 as well. So we have to come in with the same mindset. \n\n Q. What makes Pat Riley cool? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Huh? \n\n Q. What makes him cool, Pat Riley? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: What do you mean \"cool\"? \n\n Q. I was wondering in your opinion, what makes him cool? Do you think he's cool? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: He cool. There you go. \n\n Q. Can you describe that moment in Cleveland when he came up and pitched you up there. What was that like? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: It was great. I had an unbelievable meeting with not only Pat but Micky and Nick Arison and Coach Spo and Zo came. It was a great meeting. Basically gave me the blueprint about how this organization is ran, both on the court and off the court. The great thing I got out of that is about how important family is. I'm a big believer in that. Always have been throughout my life. I appreciate that, and also the product they can put on the floor as well. \r\n With D-Wade and also at the time they were talking about they could get CB as well and another free agent. I thought it was the right move. \n\n Q. Did it get you fired up? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: No, not at that point. I definitely seen something at that point when we were all talking about the players in this organization, I definitely have something to look forward to. \n\n Q. LeBron, your three-point shooting obviously has just improved throughout the playoffs. How important is that shot at the end of Game 4 in regulation in Boston? It seemed the next game you hit five and since then you've been on a tear. How critical was that shot to your confidence, if it was at all? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I think it was just a big shot, period. It was a close game at that point in The Garden. To be able to make that shot and tie the game up, it was a huge shot. It definitely was a shot that we needed at the time, and I was able to knock it down. And I just kind of just took that momentum from that game, and moved on to Game 5. \r\n Now I'm here, made a big shot in Game 2 in Chicago and a few key shots in Game 5 also in Chicago from behind the arc. And then last night I was able to make a few, also. \r\n It's not my game, though. I'm not a three-point shooter. I'm an attack guy. If a defense is going to allow me to sit and measure up a three-pointer, I'm going to take it. I have that much confidence in my shooting ability. I'm an attack-first guy. That's what I'm best at. I don't care how many threes I make, I understand that my game is in the paint. \n\n Q. Two questions: First of all, did Riles dump his championship rings on table when you met? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Yes. \n\n Q. How many? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: It was a bunch of them. I don't know. \n\n Q. The other one is that you were just saying, you were outside most of Game 1. I think you got three makes in the lane. Was that because they were sitting there watching you or a lot of help or were you just reading the situation? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I guess reading the situation. Taking what the defense gives me. They played a lot of zone. So in the zone it is to keep your perimeter attackers out on the perimeter. I was able to make a couple just swing, swing situations where the defender ran at D-Wade or ran at Mike Bibby and I was sitting in the corner by myself and I was able to hit a couple. I made a couple off the dribble. One at the end of the third and one right before the end of the third. I think like a minute on the clock I was able to pull up for a three. \r\n Just try to take what the defense gives me, and not force anything against this defense. They play so many styles, from man to zone to matchup and things like that. You have to kind of be patient and go with it. \n\n Q. Several of the Mavericks players last night were talking about they weren't really able to get into their flow of offense. They started running a lot more sets. How much of that was because they weren't rebounding well? How much is what you were doing with your perimeter defense? And just in general, what you want to do with Jason Kidd to keep him from getting into that flow of offense? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Just play our defense. This is the most challenging offense we've played in this postseason, because of the firepower that they have offensively. They have multiple guys that can shoot, multiple guys that can put the ball on the floor and create for others. They have guys in the paint that also can create in Shawn Marion and Tyson Chandler, who gets into the paint, and makes some things happen around the rim. It's a challenge for all of us. We come out with a game plan, Coach Spo and the coaching staff gives us a game plan and we go from there. Kind of just use our instincts, our athleticism and our communication defensively to try to read and react. \n\n Q. You mentioned you, Chris and Dwyane figuring out how to close games. What's allowed you specifically to do so much of it in the final five minutes in the final moments of the game? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Just seizing the moment. Understanding this is a great opportunity for not only myself but for our team to seize the moment and try to take full advantage of it. Am I going to make every shot or close every game out from now on? I hope so. I don't know. But I do put myself in the position, I do have the confidence that if I have the ball in my hands or if I get the ball in my hands that I can make a play, not only for myself but for my teammates to help us win that game. \r\n We're a really good team down the stretch now. It has a lot to do with our team as far as trust, it has a lot to do with myself and D-Wade and just the position Coach has put us in in late games to have us have an ability to come down the stretch and make shots for our team. \r\n I guess it's a confidence of closing games out, but it's also the trust you have for your teammates. When they look at you and see you need to close a game out. No matter if you fail, they look for you again to do it again. \n\n ",
  "Q. D-Wade, talk about that fourth quarter and the way you guys came out and did your thing, and you yourself doing what you do? \r\n DWYANE WADE: The fourth quarter we were able to go into the fourth quarter with a four-point lead. After LeBron hit that tough three to end the quarter and gave us a little momentum. And we just used the fourth quarter, said all right, defensively we have to win this game. Understanding that Dallas is a great offensive team. So I thought we played well defensively and they allowed us to get out and get some good shots on the other end. Obviously I made some shots tonight. But we all made plays down the stretch that helped us win the ballgame. \n\n Q. Dwyane, it was the Mavericks, it was tied, the game was a struggle. Did you think at all back -- I know during the game you don't think about five years ago, but when you got it going against them, was that same sort of karma, that same kind of feeling? And did you feel all along even with 3 of 10 in the first half it was going to happen, there would be that moment, the three and maybe some other moments? \r\n DWYANE WADE: Well, I didn't think back at all. I came out in the third quarter and I thought I was very aggressive before I went to the bench to get my rest. And I just wanted to continue that when I came back in in the fourth. I worked hard -- I've been working hard on my shot. I'm very confident. I was able to get a few to go. That's all it was. Just confidence. Guys gave me the ball, and put me in the position to do it. Just to try to come through for my team. \n\n Q. Dwyane, can you take us through that -- there was that sort of unusual delay between the starters and the actual start of the game. What was the moment like with your mom? You saw her and decided to go down there? Was that something you thought about doing? \n DWYANE WADE: It was like a five-minute delay I think they said we had. Normally I blow a kiss to my mom. I had time, a chance to hug her. Last time I did that was in Chicago in Game 2. I was able to have a talk with her on the court. We both say, here we go. We're here again. We're back. Enjoy this moment. And I just told her thanks for her support and I love her. Went out there and got it.  \n Q. LeBron, in the Chicago series Erik said you asked to be on Rose in the fourth quarter. Was that the same case tonight with Terry? \n LeBRON JAMES: No, I mean whatever. Whatever it takes for our team. You know, if I need to be on Terry or anyone on their team, I try to take the challenge. Our defense is pretty good. It's never me just guarding someone individually. But I do take the challenge on any individual matchup that I'm against. And tonight happened to be Terry mostly in the second half.  \n Q. LeBron, you guys fell behind by eight early in the third. You called a timeout and they only scored a few points in the next three and a half minutes. What changed defensively? \n LeBRON JAMES: We needed to lock in. We came out in the third quarter not paying attention to detail. Gave them an open three. DeShawn Stevenson hit an open three. Dirk hit an open shot at the top of the key. We just weren't paying attention to detail about how we were going to defend this team coming into the game. Once we slowed down and got back into what we know, what our strong point is, and that's getting stops, we were able to get out, D-Wade was able to get an and-one. Make another shot and we made a run.  \n Q. Dwyane, what have you learned about Chris, playing with him day in, day out, game in, game out that you did not know before? \r\n DWYANE WADE: Well, it's kind of like watching Chris grow during this playoff series. Obviously, we all had an opportunity to watch him play a little bit in the regular season, and not much in the playoffs. But he's been up for the challenge. He said he had a bad game today. We looked and said, I'll take 19 and 9. He's just an efficient player. \r\n So we have the luxury of having a guy like that, that is so versatile that can do so many different things. Just watching him grow up as a player in this playoff series has been awesome. \n\n Q. LeBron, what goes through your mind as you go into these fourth quarters of games, especially these key games? \n LeBRON JAMES: Defense. I think in order for us to win basketball games, we have to defend and we have to get stops, and our offense will speak for itself when we continue to get stops. I think for me going into the fourth quarter, I know it's winning time. That's when the game is won. So I got to try to dominate my individual matchup defensively, and then try to execute as best as possible. Try to get good looks, not turn the ball over. And we did a good job of doing that tonight. We got stops and we executed on the offensive end.  \n Q. Your first Finals victory, how much different does this one feel? Obviously you guys still have a lot of work left to do? How does this feel from 2007 when you were frustrated for four games? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: D-Wade said that to me. Congratulated me after the game on my first Finals victory. I mean, it feels good because it's the first game. And we played well as a team. We got a lot of work to do. We'll come in with the same mindset on Thursday, and looking forward to this challenge once again that's in front of us.\r\n It's one in the books. We're excited about this game. Tomorrow we prepare for Game 2, and obviously there's ways we can get better. \n\n Q. 38% overall, 45% from three, what were they giving you guys? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: They play a lot of zone, and the zone is to pack the paint, keep our drivers out of the paint, myself and D-Wade. And dare us to shoot threes. I think our bench came in and did a great job, Rio (Chalmers), Mike Miller did a great job against that zone, knocking shots down. \r\n We needed that boost off the bench. We know how strong their bench is, and our bench matched them tonight. And they played extremely well. When they were in the zone, they knocked down shots. Rio gave us a big boost. Mike Miller gave us a big boost, and everyone contributed. \n\n Q. LeBron, with the rhythm you seem to be in on the threes lately, is the idea you can be defended by making you shoot, like San Antonio did a couple of years ago, is that gone forever now? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Pretty much. Yeah, dare me to shoot, that's pretty much gone. I think people will still live with keeping myself and keeping D-Wade on the perimeter, but it's just my confidence. I put a lot of hard work into it, and understanding that you got to be a two-way player in this league. You have to be able to shoot the ball, you have to be able to drive and do other things to not only get yourself involved, but get your teammates involved. \n Tonight once again I shot the ball extremely well from the outside, but more importantly, it helped our team get a win. That's what it's all about.  \n Q. Dwyane, you were joking the other day that LeBron was trying to get you to watch that 40-something performance from 2006. But this time you guys added up to 40-something together. How much is that part of the idea at this point? \r\n DWYANE WADE: Well, obviously, that's one of the ideas of us playing together. For one individual to not have to carry that load. Obviously we love to have a guy explode for a 40-point night. But more so I think what he wanted me to do was look back at how aggressive I was, the mentality that I had. And I actually wasn't trying to, but I did watch Game 3 on TV last night in the fourth quarter. I see I had no conscious back then. \r\n I knew what he was doing. I knew what he was saying. And it helped me out. \n\n Q. You know, if a player has been in the Super Bowl before, even if he's the backup fullback on a team, you might tell the quarterback it's a little different. We've been in a big game. We're experienced. I want to know did Dwyane or even Udonis tell you, LeBron, anything about this being The Finals and it being different? Or was that left unsaid? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I think it was left unsaid. They understand I've been in some big games. I've been in the Finals. Didn't win a ballgame in '07, but I've been in big games before. So basically it's the same conversation we had before every game. Let's get ready to go out and continue to improve as a team, as individuals, and help lead this team to a victory. \n\n Q. For each one of you guys, Dirk said he tore the tendon in the middle finger of his left hand. How do you think it's going to affect the series? \n LeBRON JAMES: Who?  \n Q. Dirk. \r\n LeBRON JAMES: He's right-handed. He'll be all right. \n\n Q. Miller tore ligaments in both of his thumbs. \r\n DWYANE WADE: In his thumbs, everything. \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Dirk is right-handed. He shoots the ball extremely well. That left hand is just a guide hand for all shooters. We all know that. It won't affect him. He's still going to be great. He's still Dirk. \n\n Q. LeBron, D-Wade as well, can you talk about the defense that you played on Dirk Nowitzki tonight. In the Mavericks' locker room they talked about how he was not able to get to his spots and get some of the shots he normally does. \r\n DWYANE WADE: I think obviously Dirk is a great player. He's going to make shots in this series. And I thought our guys did a good job of paying attention to the detail of what we wanted to do. And just make it tough on him as much as possible. He still had 27 points, but Dirk is a very efficient player. So we'll take 7-for-18 every game we can. There's going to be some nights we're going to play the same defense and he's going to hit those shots. We can't get down about it and guys can't get frustrated. You understand he's one of the best scorers and shot-makers that this game has seen. \n\n Q. Dwyane, can you explain what went through your head when you saw LeBron James hit that end-of-third-quarter three-pointer? And LeBron, what went through your head when you saw Dwyane pull up that three-pointer, that critical one in the fourth quarter? \r\n DWYANE WADE: Momentum. I knew what he was going to do. He let the clock go all the way down to four before he decided to move. When he had it in his right hand, I knew what he was going to do. I shoot with him after practice every day, so I know him. Not many guys can make that. It's a tough shot to make. Going to your right, you have to be strong to make something like that. But that was just about a momentum swing for our team and a confidence boost going into the fourth quarter with a four-point lead. \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I mean, just to answer about D-Wade, when D-Wade is dribbling the ball, dribbling it and he gets in his rhythm, and pulls up for a three, once that went down, I knew he was feeling really good. We're rhythm players. When we get in a good rhythm, we get in a good groove, we feel like every shot we take is going to go in. Those are two cases of it. \n\n Q. You guys talked about the confidence you had going in the fourth quarters. When you were struggling with that earlier in the season, closing games out, did you ever doubt that at some point this season you would find a way to figure it out, either of you guys? \r\n DWYANE WADE: No. \r\n LeBRON JAMES: We always said that. We always said we would figure it out. We always believed in our abilities. We always believed as a team. Everything we went through, the pitfalls and the downs was going to turn and make its course. We just stuck with it and understood it. \r\n We have guys that have closed games before. We just had to figure out how to do it together. We've done it by ourselves. CB has closed games in the past. D-Wade has closed games in the past. I've closed games in the past. What we had to figure out is how do we do it together to maximize our team potential. Those pitfalls early in the season has helped us get to where we are now in the postseason. \r\n THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys. \n\n ",
  "Q. LeBron, question in two parts if you don't mind. What was it like to be on the court with all The Finals logos and signage? Does it seem real now? And secondly, I'm curious if in your shoot for those promotional shoots for ABC, did you look at the trophy, hold it, anything like that game?\r\n LeBRON JAMES: First of all, I'm honored to be here again. Now with this franchise, it's an honor. As a player we worked hard. I worked hard individually to get to this point. I had a lot of visions of being at this moment and the now it's hit me. Being on the floor and seeing the championship logos, The Finals logos, I'm very excited. \r\n I got an opportunity to see the trophy yesterday and take pictures with it. Hopefully we can bring it home. \n\n Q. Did you hold it? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Yes. They make you do everything with it. Besides take it home. \n\n Q. Considering all the ups and downs that you guys have been through this year, what's the feeling of the satisfaction of being here at this moment, being so close? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I mean, it's great satisfaction to be here. But we have a lot of work to do still. It's been a great ride so far throughout this postseason. We played some great teams starting with Philadelphia, then going with Boston and then Chicago. Three great teams. And being able to be in this moment, we've all had a vision where we all worked hard, from the start of training camp on the Air Force base. And to be here is very humbling, it's very satisfying at this point. \r\n We want more. \n\n Q. LeBron, a couple of your teammates out there were saying you're the best player in the league who doesn't have a ring yet. Other guys were arguing a guy like Jason Kidd with all the overall longevity and his stats. Is it just talent or overall body of work when you make that argument? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I don't know. That's something for you guys to break down and look at the numbers and the everything. I'm hungry for one. That was my goal coming into this league. It's been my goal. I've seen the vision over the last few years. I haven't had an opportunity to get there. I played in The Finals before; didn't win it. I got to the Eastern Conference Finals before against Orlando; lost. Had some years where we were the best team in the league in Cleveland and we didn't get back to that point. \r\n I have had this vision and now I'm back here and I'm looking to change the outcome. \n\n Q. Do you feel any differently going into this Finals versus taking Cleveland into the Spurs Finals in terms of the chances and what you think you're able to accomplish? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I feel different because I'm older, more experienced. I'm a better player at this point. You know, going into the Finals with the Spurs, I said it at the end of that Finals, I said they were a better team than us. It would have been a lot harder to digest it if we had came into a Finals with a team that we felt like wasn't better than us, didn't execute better than us, wasn't a veteran club and would have beat us. I thought the Spurs were a better team than us and took advantage of all our weaknesses. They've been to that position before. \r\n Right now I feel more comfortable because I feel like we have a veteran ballclub and we have three guys that have had rings, Eddie House and D-Wade and Udonis. We have guys that have been in the postseason year after year after year. When you have that experience, when you have guys that can make plays and take over games, you like your chances. \n\n Q. LeBron, do you still feel that this team is regarded as villains around the country? Or do you think the beautiful way you guys have played basketball is maybe starting to change it a little bit? Where do you think --\r\n LeBRON JAMES: We don't know. We don't really get into it too much. You know, we've got a lot of flack this year over mostly because of myself. And we've tried to use that as motivation every day we get on the basketball court. But just play the game of basketball. That's all we can do is play the game of basketball at a high level. Play Miami Heat basketball. That's defending at a high level with speed and athleticism. And then sharing the ball and being the team offensively. \r\n As far as this villain thing and things like that, we don't -- it is what it is. People are going to say whatever they want about us. We just got to continue to go out there and just play our game. \n\n Q. LeBron, when you look at Dirk's career, his accomplishments, 13 years of greatness, but no championship. You're obviously trying to fill that space on your resume. What does it detract from a player's accomplishment if he doesn't get that championship? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: You hear it all the time. Always say, to go down as one of the greats, you have to put a ring on your resume. I mean, as an individual, you have those dreams and you have those goals. You want to be a champion. Do you care as much as what people say about your career as far as your body of work? I don't know. I think you look at Dirk's numbers, they speak for itself over his 13-year career. You look at my numbers so far in my eight-year career, you know, it kind of speaks for itself as well. \r\n As individuals, myself and Dirk, we both are competitors, and we both know the ultimate feeling is to win, is to win a championship. Not for whatever everybody else think, but for the people we have around us. That's our teammates, our organization, our families to be able to have that moment and have that feeling. \n\n Q. LeBron, when you lose a Finals, what kind of psychological impact does that have going forward throughout your career? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Well, I mean, it all depends what type of guy you are. \n\n Q. For you personally. \r\n LeBRON JAMES: For me personally it's driven me. It's gotten me better. I go back and look at some of those games, I look at myself and say, you are a much better player than you were then. That comes from playing games, playing postseason games, losing, winning. \r\n But I took from that Finals that I just need to become better, not only as a basketball player, but as a leader on and off the court. \r\n Just use it as fuel. Is it going to happen the next year? It can happen to you individually where you become a better player. But does it always get you back to the Finals? It doesn't. There's a lot of guys that have been in The Finals, and lost and never got back. You look at Allen Iverson who got to the Finals and took the 76ers to The Finals. He was great every year, every year after that, but he was never able to get back. \r\n I'm humbled. I'm blessed that I'm able to get back to this point and to be able to redeem myself for that time when I was in The Finals against the Spurs. \n\n Q. Are you looking forward to guarding Dirk? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I'm looking forward to guarding anybody. I don't care about guarding anybody. I mean, that's what I do. I'm a defensive guy. I'm not sitting up here and saying I can stop Dirk. I don't think no one can single handedly stop Dirk. He's a shot maker. One of the best shot makers we've ever had in this league. Whoever Coach puts me on or whoever I need to take the challenge on, it doesn't matter to me. \n\n Q. Do you think he's in the top ten of all time like Carlisle says? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: As far as what? \n\n Q. Top ten players of all time. \r\n LeBRON JAMES: I don't know. Dirk is a great player. There are a lot of great players that have played in this league. Dirk is one heck of a player. The things that he's able to do out on the floor, the shot-making ability, everyone said, you forced me to a bad shot. Really it's not a comfort shot for him. It looks like a bad shot if you don't know basketball or you don't know his game. One-legged fadeaways off the glass and pull-up jumpers off the dribble, pump fake, pump fake, fadeaway, things like that. He's a great player. \n\n Q. LeBron, did people misread this whole episode with you coming to the Heat and everything? Was it more about the friendship with Wade and the two of you feeling like you can win a championship anywhere if you play together? \r\n LeBRON JAMES: Ultimately for me it was about being in the position to compete year after year after year. And not only being able to do that, but being able to do it with one of my best friends, one of the best players we have in this league today in Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. I know what this league is all about, about having multiple guys on the court that can dominate a game. \r\n With teaming up with these guys I feel like we can compete for a lot of years to come. We've proven a lot of people wrong so far. We have a lot of work to do still. \r\n Ultimately that's what it's about. Me being happy and also being able to compete at the highest level. That's what there league is about. This league is about.\n\n ",
  "Q.  What did you think of your performance individually in this series and what you learned from this series? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  It definitely could have been better.  It could have been better in order for us to win.  You know, if I don't play well, our team is not going to have a good chance to win.  You know, I've got a lot of things to work on to get better for next year. \n\n Q.  To follow up with that, I mean, what's the first thing?  Prioritizing in terms of what you need to work on for next year. \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  There's no one thing that I want to focus on intensively, it's just everything.  I need to definitely get better, and once I get better, our team will automatically get better, and I know that.  I have to do everything that I've done well and try to improve in order for us to be a better team next year. \n\n Q.  I know you're disappointed right now, but at what point will you look back and say, hey, we did some good things and be happy with what you did here? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I'm not sure.  You know, you're definitely disappointed.  I'm not disappointed in our effort the last two games, not at all.  I think we played well.  We definitely just faced a better team in this series, simple as that. \n\n Q.  Can you just talk about how much you basically have carried this franchise, but you still need help; you can't do everything by yourself?  What needs to be done maybe supporting cast-wise, and did you feel heavy pressure during the series? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I really think the team we have now is good enough to win a championship, and I really stressed that from the beginning.  It just shows we went up against a better team, simple as that.  We went up against a better team in this series, and everybody has to be better coming into next season.  I have to be ten times better.  Our team has to be ten times better.  As individuals, if we all put in the work this summer and come to training camp next year, our level automatically rises. \n\n Q.  Do you think maybe in the offseason you have to be aggressive with Danny in trying to get the right guys come in? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I'm just excited about what happened with our team this year.  You know, we gave it all.  We did what we said, made it to the championship, try to win the championship.  We won the Eastern Conference Championship.  We wanted to win the big thing, but when we look back on it, hopefully we can be satisfied, or not satisfied, but happy with what we have done. \n\n Q.  Can you just talk about your feelings when you saw the Spurs celebrating on your court and how much of a motivation will that be to have that be your team? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I didn't.  I didn't want to turn around at all and look at it, but I've seen other teams win the title before, me watching on TV, so I know what they were doing.  But I didn't turn around and look at it (smiling).  I didn't want to look at it. \n\n Q.  For you, you said you're a no-excuses team, but now that this series is over, this season is over, how much maybe was fatigue a factor for you, very uncharacteristic of you, 23 turnovers in the four games, shooting 33 percent.  Now that it's over, was fatigue a factor? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I don't think so.  I felt great throughout the whole season.  Everyone at this point is -- everyone is injured at this point, everyone is a little fatigued.  It's not an excuse.  I definitely felt good coming into this series, and I think the defensive intensity and some of the things they did kept me off guard and kept the team off guard.  The turnovers are uncharacteristic of what happened.  It was a lot of unforced things, me losing the ball or me making bad passes.  It's all things I can control, and I wasn't able to do that. \n\n Q.  What's the biggest thing that you'll take away from The Finals that will help you in the future? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  We have to be better.  Me, as an individual, I have to be much better on and off the court, and that will carry our team to higher levels.  I think it starts with me first and then it will trickle down to everybody else. \n\n Q.  What did this team learn from this series? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I'm not sure.  We haven't really talked about it.  You know, we went up against a better team.  We know the Spurs is definitely the better team in this series.  They played like it.  They never got rattled when we made runs.  They never sped up.  They played their own tempo, and they kept us off balance.  I think we learned that as good as we thought we was, there was still a team out there that was better than us. \n\n Q.  I saw you entering the pressroom and exchanging some words with Tim Duncan.  I was just wanting to know what you guys were talking about? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I was just basically congratulating him on a wonderful season, on his championship.  He's definitely a great player and he has a great supporting cast around him.  I think it's great.  If I couldn't do it, why not Tim Duncan?  He's definitely a very good player, and he definitely brings out the best in his teammates.  I think I kind of want to do the same thing and try to do the same thing with my teammates, so we're kind of the same player, me in the perimeter, him in the post. \n\n Q.  I think I heard him say the league is going to be yours soon? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  So why you ask me what he said?  (Laughter). \n\n End of ",
  "Q.  Peyton Manning was in the crowd last night, and he's always reading defenses at the line and trying to figure things out.  How much do you feel kind of like Peyton Manning with what you've seen so far and what the Spurs are doing to you defensively? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  You know, definitely they're doing a great job.  You know, I was definitely trying to read to see what they're doing at a particular time of the game.  You know, you see one guy, you might see two and now you can see another one.  So it's definitely a collective defensive attacks that they're putting on me and putting on our team. \n\n Q.  Just to follow up, in the low post yesterday, it seemed a couple of times you had one-on-one coverage and you kind of waited to see where that second guy was coming from.  Any thought of maybe attacking earlier as opposed to waiting? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  You know, I've got to read the defense first.  I've always done that.  I'd go on two dribbles and they'd go on the double-team.  We had some great looks, we just didn't knock them down.  All the shots we took from the outside was good looks.  We've just got to step in and make them. \n\n Q.  You had a lot of good looks that just didn't fall and it's been happening throughout this series, other than just obviously your luck changing, what can you do to make those jumpers go on? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Just got to continue to take them, feel confident about it and go up there and take that shot.  You know, I know I can make them, I think my teammates know they can make outside shots, we've just got to continue to take them. \n\n Q.  That last shot, the three-pointer, the coach said we talked to the official afterwards and Bruce didn't touch him.  You were on the replay saying I was fouled.  Can you talk about what you thought happened in that shot? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Definitely I thought there was some contact, but we don't want to try to make that as an excuse of why we lost the game or if it could change the game.  We had opportunities where we could have made shots before that and not put ourselves in a position to be down three with five seconds to play.  I think we all know there was some contact, but that's neither here nor there, so we don't get involved in that. \n\n Q.  In San Antonio in two games you did not play your best, did not score the points you're used to scoring and the team lost.  Last night you scored more, more active, got more things done but the team lost.  You talk about reading defenses.  Is it time to just let your talent and instinct take over in Game 4, backs against the wall, and drive more or try to impose your will more on this game? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I play my game.  My game is what I've been doing.  I see a double-team, I get a ball up.  If I don't see a double-team I try to attack and get into the lane.  If I've got an outside shot, I'll take it.  I can't change my game, what got us here.  Everything I've been doing is the reason why we're here, and our team, everything we've been doing, is the reason we're here.  We don't want to try to change anything but we know our backs are up against the wall and we have to try to win Game 4. \n\n Q.  Following up on that, obviously everybody knows the history of being down 0-3, but how do you guys have to approach the game tomorrow?  Do you have to come in just like it's one game, we win this game, and anything can happen? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Well, you have to.  We have no choice but to win or the season is over and there's a new champion.  We have to come out with the mindset to take one game at a time and just continue to try to win four in a row.  Hopefully we can do that. \n\n Q.  Can you just describe what it feels like and what you see when Bruce Bowen is on you?  Essentially what is it like to be defended by him? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I think individually he's great.  I think what also helps him is the guys that's behind him.  You know, it's not one guy in this league that can play defense on an individual by himself.  I think as a team they're very good, which allows him to pressure, which allows him to do a lot of things that some other defenders can't do because they don't have that back line behind him.  When you have a seven-footer in Tim Duncan and Oberto and Robert Horry, and you have Manu that closes in when they try to drive, it allows his one-on-one defense to be a lot more pressure, that much more physical because he knows he has that help behind him.  Individually he's great, but those guys behind him also helps him. \n\n Q.  Can you describe the differences in the coverage schemes that you saw with Detroit and what San Antonio is trying to do to you? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Well, I think Detroit, they tried to drop a lot of pick-and-rolls and tried to weak me left on the top.  I wasn't as aggressive around the perimeter, which allowed me to get into the lane a little bit.  I think San Antonio is not allowing me to come off screens without seeing another body, simple as that.  I'm seeing one or two, and if I'm getting around two I'm seeing another third guy.  They definitely have picked up in intensity, and we have to be able to exploit that.  If they're going to put two guys on me, we have to be able to do something on the backside, and if I get a ball, I have to be even more aggressive on trying to get it back when we're swinging from one side to another. \n\n Q.  Especially in that case, weak side ball movement is critical, isn't it, against these guys? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Well, definitely.  We've had opportunities where I've kicked it out of the post and nobody has had an opportunity to swing, swing or we took that first look.  Maybe we needed to swing it from one side to another to get something on the backside and therefore rotate.  I think that would help. \n\n Q.  I watched you shoot for 31 minutes early yesterday, around 6:10, 6:15.  Is there ever an indication of how your perimeter game might be in the course of a game? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Well, it's just kind of a mental thing trying to get ready and get prepared for the game.  You know those shots are not going to be there during the course of a game because you have defenders guarding you, of course, but I think just getting a warm-up, just getting a workout before the game mentally prepares you for the game definitely. \n\n Q.  To piggy-back off an earlier question, only one team has been swept in The Finals the last 11, 12 years.  How much does pride kick into that distinction? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  We gave ourselves a chance to win last night, and I've always said, and I said all year and all throughout the postseason, you give yourself a chance to win you can't feel down about it.  Defensively we were very active last night.  Offensively we got some great looks, we just weren't falling.  I was able to get into the lane a couple times and missed a couple bunnies.  We don't want to get swept, of course.  We're not even thinking about that.  We're thinking about winning a game and continuing to try to win and win a championship. \n\n Q.  You're finding out how difficult it is to win a championship.  From a player's standpoint, how do you view what the Spurs have been able to do over the last nine years? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  It's awesome.  I think they have a dynasty already at work, and I think Coach Popovich and that staff and being able to get the No. 1 pick in Duncan has really helped their franchise and the pieces here and the pieces there to make that team a championship team.  They don't have the greatest athletes in the world, they don't have the greatest shooters in the world, but they have probably the greatest team in the world, and that's what this sport is all about.  It's not about an individual.  It's not like tennis, it's not like golf.  You have to have one unit.  You have to have everybody on the same page at the same time to win basketball games. \n\n Q.  How often does Coach Brown kind of reference them and bring them up as a model with whatever you guys are doing? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  With him being a part of that franchise, why shy away from it?  When you want to be the best, you want to try to mirror image the best, and they're definitely the best team in our league at this point in time.  You want to try to do as close or exactly to what they do.  And it's going to be tough because they've been together for so long, but at the same time, you want to try to just take a little bit of something from there and try to input it into your system, definitely. \n\n Q.  72-70, you guys have the ball.  Did you not hear Mike Brown, the video showed him jumping up and down screaming at the top of his lungs for a time-out.  With the noise and everything, did you guys not hear him at all? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  No, if they would have heard him we would have called a time-out.  The time-out looking back at it when we got the ball, didn't seem like he was calling a time-out.  I think he was trying to communicate more to the refs than to us, you know, and it's -- it's no one's fault but we didn't know.  Look at that, we call a time-out there, then we don't have the two to try to tie the game up at the end, so it kind of worked in our favor. \n\n Q.  Just to follow up, the Detroit series, the two you lost there, you came away with some confidence because you played them down to the wire and had a chance to win.  Even though you're down 3-0 are you taking some positives away from yesterday? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  We took some confidence from Game 2 to Game 3.  We played with that last night.  We had a lot of energy, defensively we played extremely well.  We didn't allow them to get whatever shot they wanted like in San Antonio.  At the end we gave ourselves a chance to win.  We still feel confident.  It's all about the first team getting No. 4.  They're definitely closer than we are, but at the same time, the series is not over until somebody hits four. \n\n End of ",
  "Q.  How did you feel about what happened on the final play? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  On the three-pointer?  We had to go for a three, we were down three points.  You know, it went in and it came out. \n\n Q.  To follow up, what about the push in the back from Bruce? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  No, incidental contact. \n\n Q.  Excuse me? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Incidental contact.  It didn't affect my shot.  I had a good look at it and I missed. \n\n Q.  With about 15 seconds left you spun into Duncan, gave it to Varejao.  Were you expecting to get it back on that play and make another move, or what was your thinking on that? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Oh, absolutely.  I had been aggressive in the fourth quarter.  I was definitely going to get it back from Andy, but Andy made a good move.  He just over-shot it.  I definitely wanted to try to get a good look at it or give my teammate a better look at it, but it was just miscommunication. \n\n Q.  Seventeen turnovers for you in the first three games.  You're only shooting about 35 percent.  Is it their defense that's causing this, or are you just having off nights? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Well, tonight was definitely a couple.  I didn't think that went my way.  I had an offensive foul, but I didn't think that was a foul.  Their defense was definitely good, and they're definitely making me work for everything I do. \n\n Q.  Can you just talk about the situation you guys are down now, 3-0, and just what kind of mentality you have to have at this point? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Well, everybody has to still believe.  You know, it is the first of four games, but we dug ourselves a big hole, and we have to come out aggressive and just continue to play hard.  We gave ourselves a chance to win tonight and that's all we can ask for. \n\n Q.  Is it one of those things, don't listen to what history says? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Absolutely.  We can't live on history, but at the same time we have dug ourselves a big hole, and we know that.  We have to come out and try to win four straight games. \n\n Q.  Do you feel you've imposed your will on this series?  It seemed a lot of times coming off the picks that it's there and you're still going left to right when you don't drive.  Do you sense that at all in these three games? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  This is all about them.  They played very good defense.  They played elbows and boxes and if I'm coming off someone that's there and I have to swing the ball to a teammate or I come off a pick-and-roll and they're there again.  It's all about me not trying to force anything and to try to go for it when I can.  I did a good job of not forcing it tonight, got into the lane and missed a couple bunnies that rimmed in and rimmed out.  Definitely I found some creases tonight. \n\n Q.  How unexpected was Bruce Bowen's offensive play tonight? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  It was definitely good for them because Manu struggled, Tony struggled, and Tim Duncan didn't shoot the ball well from the field, so Bruce definitely kept them in the game in the first half hitting three big threes, and defensively he's very good.  So he definitely helped them. \n\n Q.  Coming off your Eastern Conference Finals experience, did you think that it would actually be this tough?  Are you surprised?  And I guess, how would you sum this up so far, your personal experience? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I'm not surprised on how tough it is.  I kind of envisioned it being tough.  I think the Eastern Conference Finals was tough, and I knew it was going to pick up another level.  I think our team senses that, also.  You know, the experience factor, we don't like to make any excuse, but it definitely played a part in this Finals against a world power team in the Spurs. \n\n Q.  Can you just talk about the discipline that the Spurs showed at the defensive end with you when you guys screen roll, post, repost, get the ball back to you at the top and there's still two guys shading you and another over the top? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Definitely.  I think Coach Pop and their defensive staff has put in a great defensive plan against me.  Any little crease I find they're still having guys coming over me, and if I do finish they make me finish over bodies.  I really expect that and I love the challenge.  It's fun going out there and seeing different defenses and trying a pick here and a pick there.  You've got to give all the props to the Spurs and all the props to Coach Pop and his staff.  They've done so far a wonderful job. \n\n End of ",
  "Q.  These first two games, unlike Detroit, you had a chance to win with the ball pretty much on the final possession.  You came away fairly confident going back home.  These two games you were down 18 yesterday and 29 -- or two days ago, 18 and then 30.  What do you take from these first two games going back to Cleveland?  How different is the feeling? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  We're definitely still confident.  It doesn't matter if you lose by 1 or lose by 30 with us.  A loss is a loss, and we've been down 2-0 before in this situation, so we have to find a way to bring the intensity that we did in the fourth quarter tonight and carry it on to Game 3. \n\n Q.  Why do you think the intensity doesn't come for this team until the fourth quarter?  You dig yourselves a big hole but in the fourth quarter it's there. \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I don't know, I think the fourth quarter we just realize that it's a pride thing then, and we don't want to get blown out.  We're here for a reason, and it becomes a pride thing in the fourth quarter when you're down so many points. \n\n Q.  Is it an upgrade in competition going from Detroit to San Antonio, and if so, how large? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I think it's just an upgrade from series to series, you know, from the first round to the second round, Conference Finals, and then to The Finals it's an upgrade.  It doesn't matter who it is, the intensity level automatically picks up.  The team is better.  It doesn't matter if it's Detroit or the Spurs.  Every round gets a little harder. \n\n Q.  Do you feel like the competition, though, is -- just in terms of the ability of the opponent, do you feel -- is it a big difference? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I think the intensity is a big difference.  Like I said, I don't -- you give the Spurs a lot of credit, but everyone knows that each round picks up, and the team picks up.  You get better after you win one series.  You get better when you win the Conference Finals and get to The Finals.  You get better as a team, and the intensity definitely picks up. \n\n Q.  What was it like for you having to sit and watch so much of the first quarter and then obviously you came out a little bit colder? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  It's not a good thing for me.  I can't remember the last time I didn't play 40-plus minutes.  I got two quick fouls and it definitely didn't work in our team's favor.  I wanted to be out there to try to help my team win, and being in early foul trouble definitely hurt us. \n\n Q.  Coach Brown was pretty critical of the team's effort in the first two-thirds of the game.  What do you think the team's effort was and how do you fix it? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  We can play better.  We can play harder.  It shows, the difference the first three quarters or the first half compared to the second half.  At one point we were shooting 57 percent from the field, and that hasn't been us.  We have to find a way to pick up our intensity and carry on what happened in the fourth quarter into the rest of the game. \n\n Q.  You've seen Tony Parker for a couple of games.  You were guarding him tonight.  Do you have any sense of what you guys can do to keep him out of the paint? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I don't know (laughing)  you know, he's very good, probably the second best point guard we've played in this postseason.  Jason Kidd is one, I think Tony Parker is two.  No matter what you do he's going to find a way to get into the paint.  He can finish over big guys, finish over small guys.  They have a great one in Tony Parker for sure. \n\n Q.  Is going zone a possible remedy to this? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  No, that's kind of a cop-out.  We don't want to go zone.  We're a man team, we have to man up and try to keep him out of the paint.  We have to make our best effort.  We made him take a lot of jump shots tonight, which he made.  He made a three.  I think when he's shooting the ball as well as he did tonight there's no way you can stop him. \n\n Q.  The big three for the Spurs, they are the big three, but can you talk about Robert Horry and the veteran presence?  I mean, he just did so many things tonight to kind of get this victory for him? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  He definitely did a great job defensive, came up with a lot of blocked shots, rebounded the ball extremely well on the offensive and defensive rebound.  He's been here before, and it's nothing new to him.  It doesn't matter if he's out there for five minutes or for 25 minutes, he's definitely going to give his best effort, and he was definitely a spark off the bench. \n\n Q.  Can you talk about or explain to people that aren't from Cleveland how big it will be to have this game there on Tuesday, and just to be a part of that history? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  It's definitely going to be a great experience I think for all Cleveland fans, for northeast Ohio, for the whole state of Ohio.  It's going to be something that hasn't been experienced in a long, long time for our city, for our fans.  It's going to be electrifying.  If you're not there, I expect you to try to get there. \n\n Q.  What are you telling people that are asking you for tickets right now? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  No (laughter). \n\n Q.  It seems like after every game we're talking about Daniel Gibson, another big game tonight.  You seem even a little looser on the court when he's out there.  Can you address that? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I just think he understands how to play the game of basketball, and he knows that he's going to get some great looks, but he knows if the guys run him off the three-point line, he knows how to finish in the lane.  He's getting better every game, every series, and it's great to see him grow and watch him continue to grow.  I think he's definitely one of the best players on our team. \n\n End of ",
  "Q.  How many times have you watched a game tape over the past few days and do you feel you have a pretty good sense of what the Spurs are trying to do against you defensively? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I watched it twice, same answer as yesterday.  I don't want to dwell on it.  I don't want to put too much inside my thinking process on what I'm going to do to attack their defense. \n\n Q.  Robert Horry said that he thinks you're rope-a-doping them a little bit.  Can you tell us a little bit about how your approach or mindset changes from Game 1 to 2 to 3 as the series progresses?  It seems like something changes with you.  Take us through that process that you go through. \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  It's just mentally and just trying to read the defense as much as possible and just try to be better the next game.  I've done a great job of preparing myself from one game to another, and I definitely feel like it's going to be a bounce-back game for me tomorrow night. \n\n Q.  Tomorrow night at 9:00 p.m. do you think America is going to be more interested in Tony Parker or Tony Soprano? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  (Laughing) that's a great question.  I did have my girlfriend TiVo(r) the Sopranos definitely so when I get home I'll be able to watch it.  But I think I'll be more focused on Tony Parker, even though I am a fan of Tony Soprano. \n\n Q.  And ultimately what do you think is going to happen to Tony Soprano? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Me and my guys have definitely sat down and think about it.  My friends think that either the Feds are going to come and get him or he's going to make friends with the Feds and maybe snitch on a lot of people, or he's going to be whacked, which I don't think is going to happen.  I hope that he's just able to get away and not worry about nothing (laughter). \n\n Q.  Thank you. \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I'm serious, I'm a big Sopranos fan, and this is the first time I finally got a question which is not the same question I've been hearing all year.  I appreciate that.  That was awesome because I told you I'm pretty tired of answering the same questions, so I appreciate it. \n\n Q.  I don't think he'll get whacked, either. \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I hope not. \n\n Q.  Bruce Bowen's wife had a baby, I think, overnight.  Do you think that that gives you a little bit of an edge going into the game? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  No, absolutely not.  Congratulations.  I didn't know that.  Congratulations to him and his family.  That's awesome.  I'm expecting any day.  Well, I'm not (laughter).  That would be kind of weird, but Savannah is expecting any day.  I think it's a great time for his family, and it's not going to take away from nothing that he does on the basketball court. \n\n Q.  Are you going to maybe induce labor to have it on an off day? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  No, we're just going to -- she's going to just play it by ear.  Whatever happens, happens.  We're very excited about it, and we can't wait. \n\n Q.  What do you think you can do to get your teammates some better shots and what can they do to help you out? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Just like I said in the last series, I think they're very good when you allow them to set up in the half court defensively, and that's the same with Detroit.  Just try to get up and down the court a little bit quicker and try to get some earlier looks on the shot clock where they're not set as much.  Try and make the easy pass, don't go for the hard pass.  They're very good at shrinking the floor and closing out some of my shooters.  We have to do a better job of dribble penetrating, getting to the lane and then kicking out instead of just making the hard pass from one side of the court to the other side. \n\n Q.  Coach talked a couple days ago about mental mistakes.  He said that was the biggest thing you guys did.  What are some of the mental mistakes you guys feel you can fix going into this? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Offensively and defensively we're a lot better.  We did play pretty good defense, but offensively were weren't sharp at all.  I wasn't sharp offensively, and that trickles down to the rest of our team.  If I'm not sharp then it's going to be very tough for us to win ball games.  Mentally we had a great practice yesterday and we're looking forward to having another one today. \n\n Q.  I hope this is a question you haven't answered before, too.  In terms of your shooting, do you think you have a tendency to fade to your left, which flattens your trajectory?  Do you have a tendency to do that?  And with your physical jumping ability, why don't you like go up straight more, just straight in front of the defensive guy and shoot it right in his eye because you can jump over anybody? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Are you a shooting coach? \n\n Q.  As a hobby -- \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I'm looking for one (laughter).  I've been told that before.  It's just sometimes it's natural for me to fade.  You know, I think a lot of my shots go in when I fade, a lot of them go in when I jump straight up, so it's something I'm definitely going to work on and get better with.  But trajectory and all that stuff, I don't know. \n\n Q.  In the interest of putting yourself in the other person's shoes, if LeBron the journalist was sitting out here, what would he ask LeBron the player in this situation that would elicit an answer we haven't heard before? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I don't know (smiling).  I just think -- \n\n Q.  Not so easy, is it? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  It's not easy at all.  That's why I'm not sitting out there, I guess. \n\n Q.  You got to know Bowen a little bit during the summer, and he's got this reputation as being kind of a dirty player but he does all kinds of community service.  What did you learn about Bruce?  What kind of guy is he? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  He's definitely a team-oriented guy, and he communicates well with his teammates, and that's off the court.  You know, it's definitely family first with him and basketball second, and any time you get an opportunity to sit down with a guy like that -- you know, we have a guy like that on our team, Eric Snow, who really cares about everything else besides basketball because basketball is going to take care of itself.  You really respect a guy like that who really respects your family and things that you do off the court, community service, things like that and things besides basketball.  I think that means a lot to a person like me, and I really respect Bruce and Eric being open like that. \n\n Q.  You've faced double-teams before, but going into Game 2 knowing that you're going to face double and triple-teams, how is that going to change your approach to the way you do things offensively going into this game? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Well, you definitely look at it and see how you can attack it a little bit better.  But it's not going to make me that much more passive.  I've definitely faced double-teams and triple-teams throughout this postseason, so I have to do a better job of trying to attack the double-team early and see if I can swing it to the other side to a teammate that can make a play, also. \r\n We got into too many late shot clocks in Game 1, which is not good for us.  We don't work well when we get into the shot clock down at 3 and 2 on the clock, and it makes us make bad plays.  We just have to do a better job of trying to attack the double-team and being a little bit more aggressive getting to the lane. \n\n Q.  Since you gave us such a good answer on the Sopranos, what was the last movie you saw and give us a quick critique of it? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  The last movie I saw was -- what was it?  I don't remember.  Spiderman III was the last movie I seen.  It was a little bit too romantic, but it was very good.  It was very long, but it was a little bit too romantic for me, I guess. \n\n Q.  Are you more like the black Spiderman? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I liked the black Spiderman.  He was very funny.  He couldn't dance at all, but he was very funny. \n\n End of ",
  "Q.  How much did championship experience play a factor in last night's game?  Is there anything you can do to kind of close the gap the rest of the series? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  It definitely played a lot, us never being a part of it, but that's not an excuse for us, because we've been in games in the Eastern Conference Finals we've never been apart of and we didn't make an excuse.  It's something we've been able to adjust throughout the course of a series.  That's going to be the biggest thing to try to, adjust to Game 2 from Game 1 and get better. \n\n Q.  Tony Parker last night had 12 buckets, 11 were in the lane.  Why is it so hard to keep him from getting to the rim even though you know that's his intention? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I guess if every team in the NBA knew the answer he wouldn't be able to lead the league in points in paint all the time.  He's very good, he's very quick, and he knows where he wants to get on the court.  It's very difficult, but basically we're going to have to challenge ourselves to keep him out of the paint.  But at the same time, I think their team does a great job of executing some of the defensive schemes against him which allows him to get to the paint.  We'll have to contain him a little bit better. \n\n Q.  I preface this by saying I know you're 22 and your focus is basketball, but on the larger issue of social issues, what does your gut tell you when you're done playing basketball, do you think you're going to be more Muhammad Ali or more Michael Jordan? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I'm going to try to be more of LeBron James.  When I say that, I just want to hopefully end my career the best way that I want to end it and then just try to be more of a businessman, which I can try to set up things for my family and try to pass the word on to younger kids and to older adults, I guess, in the business side of things.  I've definitely been working that right now to try to brace myself for when the NBA career is over because I know it doesn't last forever. \n\n Q.  You talked the other day about being a quick learner.  What do you do between games to get better and study and make the adjustments that you need to make? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  For me, I watch a lot of film.  I watched the game last night when I got back to the room, and I'm probably going to watch it again tonight to see throughout the course of the game what they tried to do defensively against me, and offensively, also.  I think I'm going to make little adjustments today at practice because they're probably going to -- Coach is probably going to simulate some of the things they did against me today at practice and I'll be a better player tomorrow or Sunday. \n\n Q.  In the Detroit series one of the things you talked about adjusting was being more aggressive to the hoop.  Is there anything -- \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Sometimes it's about being more aggressive and then sometimes it's about reading things and mentally trying to prepare yourself the best way to try to counter some of the things they do defensively.  You know, they may have caught some of our guys off guard, including myself at times during the course of Game 1, and I think we've played enough playoff games to know how to make the adjustment the next game. \n\n Q.  I just talked to Z.  He said he was happy with the looks he got last night, he just didn't make them.  Do you feel the same way?  Was it just missing shots you normally make? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I think it was a little bit of both.  I think if no one is on the court you make those kind of shots but you've got to give their defense a lot of credit.  But at the same time, we definitely struggled from the field last night missing a lot of shots that we normally make.  I think Z missed a lot of lay-ups that he usually makes, I missed some pull-ups that I normally make, but we don't take nothing away from their defense. \n\n Q.  How much of that was due to 21 standing back there and he's kind of the eraser if somebody gets by their guy? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  He's definitely a good defender.  It's easy to -- I don't want to say it's easy, but it's great insurance when you have a guy like that behind you that protects the lane like he does.  It gives them the opportunity to get out and run. \n\n Q.  What was the similarities and differences for the Spurs' defense that they did on you? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Well, the similarities, that's been happening to me all playoffs, they've double and triple-teamed me at times and made me give the ball up and tried to deny me from getting it back.  I'm going to have to make the easy pass and rely on my teammates a little bit more, which I'm going to do and have done throughout the postseason.  I think it wasn't anything different that they did, I just think they did a great job of rotating once I gave the ball up to some of my shooters on the backside, not to allow them to set their feet and get off good looks. \n\n Q.  There's been a lot of talk of lack of scoring, but how much about the turnovers bother you? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  That bothers me more than anything.  The six turnovers that I had is very uncharacteristic of me throughout these postseason.  I've been able to take care of the ball.  I think there was a lot of unforced turnovers, a couple slams from behind, one went off my leg.  So no, the scoring doesn't matter to me.  I think the fact I was able turn the ball over as much as I did which allowed them to get extra possessions hurt me more than anything. \n\n Q.  At 22 years old there's some things you haven't gone through.  I noticed the last three opening games of the series you did not have your game.  Do you see yourself kind of feeling your way through every series as you get through your first Conference Finals and in our your first NBA Finals? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I think so.  The first game I kind of feel my way through it and kind of make an adjustment.  I don't plan to go out there and not shoot the ball well or not score.  I do a great job of adjusting from game to game, and I think my teammates do the same. \n\n Q.  Have you learned from the past two Game 1s and the way you've rebounded?  You've kind of been there, done this by now, right? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Yeah, I guess (smiling). \n\n Q.  Under normal circumstances if you struggled in a game you'd come out aggressive the next game, try to establish yourself a little quicker.  In your case, you're coming out against one, two and three guys eye-balling you all the time.  How exactly do you handle that? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  You know, when you say you want to be a little more aggressive, that doesn't mean aggressive to shoot.  That just means try to be aggressive getting to the lane and making a better shot for your team, or if you have a better shot then go for it.  Aggressiveness doesn't mean you have to shoot every time you get into the lane or you want to force some things.  But it's definitely going to be a point of emphasis for me to try to be aggressive in Game 2, try to get better shots for my teammates where they don't have to worry about a hand in their face and try to get better shots for myself. \n\n Q.  You guys have had a world of playoff experience the last two years.  How would you describe the mindset of the team coming off last night going forward into the second game? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  We're very confident.  You know, that's why it's a series.  I said last night, it's not the NCAA tournament where you lose one game and you're going home.  This is a series, and we're down 1-0.  We've been in this position before.  We've been down 2-0 and came back and won a series, so it's nothing new to us, but this is definitely a different beast we're playing against.  We don't want to go down 2-0 against this team.  We have to come out and prepare ourselves the best way Sunday and come out and try to win the ballgame. \n\n End of ",
  "Q.  LeBron, you've got one game out of your way.  How much tonight was just your shot not falling, jitters?  What was going through your mind tonight? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  You definitely give a lot of credit to the Spurs.  They definitely played well tonight defensively, offensively.  Some of it was me missing a lot of the shots that I usually make and some of it was the defense that they put on me and on our team in general.  It's like a half and half thing. \n\n Q.  Can you guys just talk about especially you, LeBron, their double teams and how you can't go anywhere with two guys on you? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  We're going to have to make adjustments.  You're coming to Game 1 you don't know what to expect.  We don't know what they're going to run against us offensively.  We've got to make adjustments in Game 2.  A lot of credit to the, they played extremely well defensively.  It's a series.  Things happen.  They're up 1-0 and we'll make adjustments and be ready for Sunday. \n\n Q.  Just individually what was it like for you? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  It was definitely crowded.  They did a great job of shrinking the floor.  If I went by one guy, another guy stepped up, something I'm going to have to make an adjustment for for Game 2.  I'll definitely be ready to counter some of the things they did defensively. \n\n Q.  Coach Brown used the expression \"struggled mightily\" for you.  How would you describe how you played tonight? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I didn't play extremely well, definitely.  Not just shooting the ball, but the six turnovers was uncharacteristic of me in the postseason, tried to force a lot of passes in there that looked open at times but really wasn't.  I have to play better, and for us to win, me being the leader of this team, I have to play better in order for us to have a chance to win down the stretch, and my teammates know I'm going to bring my better effort in Game 2. \n\n Q.  How did it feel for you out there? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I feel good.  A lot of shots I took is shots that I make.  They felt pretty good, they just didn't fall for me.  Things like that happen.  You have one off night, but the thing like this is it's not like the NCAA tournament where you have one game and you're out.  We've got to regroup and be ready for Game 2. \n\n Q.  As poorly as you played the first half, you're only down five at halftime, they come out and here we are a different series, same old story again.  Their adjustments, your lack of adjustments?  What is it about the third quarter? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Same answer I keep giving.  We don't know.  We haven't put our finger on the third quarter yet.  We did a better job last year in Game 5 and Game 6 of playing great basketball in the third quarter, but once again it caught up with us again.  We don't know what it is but we did a great job of figuring it out.  We're going to do it pretty soon.  We definitely want to get a win on this floor before we go back home. \n\n Q.  Seems like the deeper you go into the playoffs the more people they're sending at you and now it looks like basically you're being played by one, two and three people watching you all the time.  Does it change the game for you? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  No, it doesn't.  I know I'm going to see a lot of double teams, at times triple teams.  It's something I've seen before and it's something I've been able to adjust to from game to game and in different series of this postseason.  It's not like I've never seen a double-team or triple-team before, I just have to play better, and I definitely have a better effort on Sunday. \n\n Q.  Drew, just curious, you guys beat them twice during the season.  What do you see differently in this team and what they do defensively than maybe you've seen throughout these playoffs, even during the season?  This is a team that's been here before and they know how to step it up. \r\n DREW GOODEN:  I think the scouting comes into play right there because the beginning of the year you're running sets, and this time of year you're not running those same sets.  I think they did a great job watching us in all our series, knowing what we like to run and try and take us out of it and make us feel uncomfortable. \n\n Q.  It seemed like they did that in a lot of ways.  There were some plays you ran against Detroit that they had an answer for. \r\n DREW GOODEN:  Exactly.  That's the good thing about this series.  You have time to make adjustments.  We're going to look back at the tape and see what type of adjustments we need to make, go out there and execute for Game 2. \n\n Q.  Drew, where does this team stand in terms of other teams you've played on, on being able to adjust from series to series or game to game?  Why do you think you guys are going to be able to do this? \r\n DREW GOODEN:  This is the best team we've faced, and we know that.  I think from our roots, our coaching staff, rooting from the San Antonio, trying to simulate the same things they're doing, we kind of use them as a measuring stick to see where we're at.  I think we are comfortable running our offense against them and our defensive principles, but at the same time, their experience I think kind of overcame us in this first game.  Like I said, we'll make adjustments and we'll be all right. \n\n Q.  Drew, in addition to LeBron getting his hot hand a little bit in the fourth quarter, you guys played much better and never quit.  Anything stand out in your mind that you began to do better in the fourth that you can take over to Sunday? \r\n DREW GOODEN:  I kind of got the guys together in the fourth quarter and I said there's one thing we need to let this team know and every team we've played in the past that we're not going to let it down.  We're going to take possession until the time runs out and see where we're at.  We did that to close Game 1, so hopefully the intensity will carry over into Game 2. \n\n Q.  LeBron, in the Eastern Conference playoffs a lot of the guys who were defending you overplayed you and tried to force you left.  Bruce tried to play you straight up and didn't force you either way.  How did that impact the way you played? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I think defensively he's very good.  He's one of the best defensive players in this league, and the guys behind him help him a lot.  It gives him an opportunity to get up into me and force me into the bigs, and the bigs are very good, Elson and Duncan, of course.  He has a lot behind him.  He doesn't have to do it by himself.  I'm able to go right and left, so there's nothing that I can't do out on the ball court.  I'll just have to make an adjustment and come into Game 2 with a better mindset and try to get a win. \n\n Q.  Here's a football analogy.  It seems like they wanted to make you go east and west instead of north and south.  Is that a fair assessment? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  That's definitely a fair assessment and I have to do a better job of trying to recognize that, trying to attack north and south instead of east and west.  They tried to make me dribble out towards the side line.  The bigs did a great job coming off pick-and-rolls, of showing hard and allowing Bruce to get underneath the big, try and attack me coming right underneath the big.  I think our coaching staff is very aware of what was going on, what happened in Game 1.  I think our players are very aware of what happened in Game 1, and we'll make an adjustment.  It's not like we haven't been in this situation before. \n\n End of ",
  "Q.  Mike just talked with you guys treating this as the next game and the next series, but clearly it's not that.  When you look at the media hype, The Tonight Show is here.  Do you enjoy the circus-like atmosphere that surrounds all this leading up to the games? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Well, for us it really is.  To everybody else it might not be the next game or next playoff series, but to us it is.  That's how we've approached every game in this postseason, from round 1 all the way from the Eastern Conference Finals and now to The Finals.  That's the way we approach it.  We don't try to make it more than what it is.  It's a basketball game and we have to approach it like that, with our same mindset we've been doing throughout this postseason. \n\n Q.  You obviously were in Ohio when the Cavs had all those losing years before they got you.  When was it like watching them and following them during those troubling times and how much pride does it give you to help turn around the franchise the way it has been? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Well, for me growing up it really wasn't bad for me because I wasn't really on professional sports at all.  I didn't know what was going on with professional sports.  I was just trying to play AU basketball and play little league football and things like that.  So it really wasn't a big deal for me.  But as I grew up and started to learn more about it and then being the No. 1 pick to Cleveland and knowing the history about Cleveland sports, it really meant a lot to finally bring home a championship to the city of Cleveland.  You just seen how the fans reacted after. \n\n Q.  Coach said that Eric Snow talked to you guys from his experience in the NBA Finals.  What did Eric tell you besides the media and the ticket stuff?  What did he tell you to expect in these NBA Finals? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Just to have fun.  I mean, this is fun times for us, and there should be no reason to add any more pressure onto it.  This is fun times for us, and we've earned it.  We've played just as many games as everybody else in this postseason, so we've definitely earned the right to be here. \r\n And at the same time, we have to be mentally focused and approach it like it's business.  It's always been business for us throughout this postseason, and him being the only one as a player, besides Coach Brown, and Danny Ferry being part of the Finals, he knows what it's about, so we listened to his word and we approached him in practice yesterday and we're going to try to do the same today. \n\n Q.  Can you just talk about just the Spurs, what you think about them defensively, and also just the perceived pressure on you for this team to win a championship, you've got to get in there? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I think defensively they're one of the best teams in the NBA.  You know, they work well together on the defensive end.  You know if you beat one guy, another guy steps up.  They've been pretty good throughout the years on the defensive end. \r\n But it's no added pressure for me.  There's no added pressure for our team to go out there and try to pressure.  We just know we've got to go out there and play as hard as we can and give ourselves an opportunity to win.  We've definitely been able to do that. \n\n Q.  Once you did start paying attention to sports history, it obviously stuck because you know a lot about it.  What are your favorite Finals moments? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  My favorite Finals moment is probably the last shot Michael had in Utah to end the series, thinking that was going to be his last shot ever in the NBA uniform and to retire on top like he did, hitting a game-winner on the road, was definitely my No. 1 favorite moment of watching the NBA Finals. \n\n Q.  Did you see the Dr. J. shot?  Do you remember that -- I know you weren't born then, but -- \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  That was pretty nice, too (laughter). \n\n Q.  We all know you guys are going to China for the China Games in October.  Do you believe you guys can go to China with the trophy? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Me? \n\n Q.  You guys, the team. \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Cleveland?  Yeah, that's why we're here (smiling).  We're going to try to do our best to bring it there, absolutely. \n\n Q.  Do you feel 22? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  No, absolutely not (laughter). \n\n Q.  And why not?  And how old do you feel? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I feel like -- I just feel like a veteran.  I don't say I don't feel 22, I'm not hurting or anything like that, my body is not down or anything like that.  I just feel like when you look at a guy like Daniel Gibson playing on the backcourt with you, or you look at Sasha and Andy, you know these guys look like younger guys to you, but when you really look at it, Sasha and Andy are really older than me, but I'm kind of the leader and I'm kind of the role model for those guys. \r\n As a basketball player, I don't look -- I don't feel 22 until I really get off the court, and then I'm back and doing my usual video games and running around the house and stuff with my son, things like that.  That's when I feel 22 again. \n\n Q.  There's a long list of elite players that have never won an NBA title.  Do you feel like you need to have one to be considered a great? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I don't know.  That's not my room to say.  You know, when you look at guys who become greats, it's because of their athletic ability and their ability to do the things that they did as an individual, and I don't get involved in individual things like why do they base your game on and things like that.  That satisfies me more than anything about winning a championship, just to get the satisfaction for my teammates.  I think you become one of the greats by doing a lot of things as an individual.  They don't base that on your team's perspective and things like that. \n\n Q.  You've made such a dramatic improvement as a team in the past couple years defensively since Mike Brown took over.  This league is known for glorious offensive talents like yourself.  Has it made you appreciate the last couple years a little bit more, understanding, like, yeah, that is the way you've got to succeed to win titles? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  That is definitely fun.  It is fun to really know that you can get stops on the defensive end, and I've been on both sides of the fence where I couldn't get stops or as a team we couldn't get stops, and it made it harder on the offensive end.  When you have a coach that tells you, hey, you guys go out there and get stops, you play defense for me and I'll let you do what you want on the offensive end, then it makes you play a lot harder. \n\n Q.  What you just accomplished against Tayshaun Prince, who we know has elevated his offensive game tremendously, what kind of a source of pride did that give you in that series that you pretty much rendered him effectiveless? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  It's a pride thing for us, and it's a pride thing for me to say I don't want my man to score.  You know, I kind of played both sides of the fence.  I played offense and defense in the Detroit series and I took pride in doing it because I don't want to be the one guy on the court that's not playing defense and I've got four other guys working their ass off on the defensive end.  It's not about that.  You've got to play both sides of the fence.  It just brings so much excitement when you know you can go out there and get a stop and get a run out on the other end. \n\n Q.  How quick a learner are you when you're put in a new situation? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I'm very quick.  I've always got compliments on that from coaches I've played for saying I'm a quick learner.  I'm able to adjust fast to what's going on throughout the course of a game or throughout the course of life, honestly.  I've been pretty good with it thus far. \n\n Q.  What do you expect -- this is your first NBA Finals.  What do you expect are those things you're going to have to learn and adjust to on the fly, because I know it's another series, but it is a different situation? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  Well, it is, but it was a different situation for us also being in the Eastern Conference Finals, never being part of that as an individual.  I learned from game to game to game how to adjust.  How do you adjust for the road crowd, how do you adjust for the home crowd.  I mean, I don't know, how can I explain it to you until I get into the fire, and then I'll be able to adjust on the fly and I'll be able to answer a lot better probably after Game 1, let you know how I was able to adjust throughout the course of the ballgame. \n\n Q.  But you feel good? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  I feel great.  I'm ready. \n\n Q.  So many of the experts are picking against you guys.  Do you kind of feel like you have to have that us-against-the-world kind of mentality going into this series? \r\n LEBRON JAMES:  No, we haven't been on the everyone-picks-the-Cleveland-Cavaliers side yet (smiling), so there's nothing new for us.  We just go out there and we play great basketball.  You earn respect and you get respect by playing great basketball, and we've done that throughout the last two years.  We haven't looked in the paper yet and seen the Cavaliers is picked to win the series or picked to win the game, so it's nothing new. \n\n End of "
